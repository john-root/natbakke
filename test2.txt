10 miles that lies within the Reservation which at times

gets bad. Under normal conditions one can drive from Farmington
in less than two hours and I have never known this road to be
impassable.

Nothing has been done during the past year to remove
the menace of the San Juan River. That this stream has not
molested us during thEs period is due solely to the fact
that there has been no high water. I confidently eXpect with
the first high water that this stream will leave its presant
channel at a point some two hundred or three hundred yards
above the steel bridge, creating for itself a new channel to
the north of the bridge, leaving the bridge spanning a dry
channel. This bridge is on the Gallup road which is about to
become a Federal Aid Highway and we are hoping and expecting
that the authorities that rebuild this highway will recognize
the condition and take steps to remedy it.

The building program is rapidly nearing completion.
This work was delayed by two causas,— first, by a lack of ﬂunds
which was overcome in a very short time. Nevertheless, even
this apparent shortage worked serious havoc with our plans.
Orders had been placed with successful bidders for all plumbing,
heating, and electrical equipment when a wire was received ad-

vising of this lack of funds, hence, these orders were at once

cancelled. A few days later additional funds were secured.

However, the Dealers were unwilling to reinstate the cancelled

on the reservation. It is a fact that he makes very few
visits to the reservation, usually only in Case of accident
or epidemic. Of course he makes a few visits, to patients
not far distant from Shiprock, in addition to those mentioned.
However, during these absences his work at headquarters is
necessarily neglected and suffers accordingly. The other
Physician is stationed at the Toadlena Boarding School and is
able to get out on the reservation to some extent, and does
get out a great deal more than does the man now located at
Shiprock. However, he is able to cover only a comparatively
small territory.

The Presbyterianmghggch maintains a hOSpital and
a Physician at Red Rocks, ﬁQ/south west of Shiprock, but,
even with this aid, more than 509% of the jurisdiction is
normally without medical attention other than that furnished
by the Medicine Men and these latter named gentry certainly
thrive. This is especially regrettable for the Navajo Indian
is not adverse to the treatment and medicine of the white Phy-
‘sician and usually, when he fails to employ such Physician, it

is because none is available which is the normal condition.

The NaVajos are a peace-loving people. They have to

work for a,1iving and it keeps them mighty busy. Extracting a
living from this desert is no holiday. Sometimes they quarrel

and, when they do, it is usually over water or range. Occasionally

orders which necessitated readvertising, thus Causing a long
delay. Second, the Saw Mill burned, making it necessary to
replace certain portions, thus creating a further delay. However,‘
all obstacles have been overcome and the new Mesa Boarding School
with a capacity of 200, 100 boys and 100 girls, will be in 0p-
eration this coming September. This School is located Some 500
yards east of the San Juan School and will be Operated in con-
nection with the latter named institution, under the management
of the same Principal, using the same laundry, the same sewing—
room, the same farm and garden, the same dairy herd, the same
hOSpital, being otherwise independent. The Old HOSpital Building
at the San Juan School, which has served little purpose since

the completion of the New Hospital several years ago, has also

been remodeled and a second story added, and it now furnishes

quarters for several employees, greatly relieving the congested

condition heretofore existing.

There are sufficient employees to care for the Agency
grounds and buildings but not sufficient properly to administer
' the affairs of the reservation. The Field Force consists of two
District Farmers, one Stockman, and an inadequate police force.
But two Physicians are provided for the entire jurisdiction. i
One Of these is.stationed at Shiprock and l might almost say he
is anchored there, fer, with 400 pupils together with the
hoSpital, which is usually full, together with the employees and

their families, he has almost no Opportunity to attend to any work

they have marital difficulties. Once in a while a man endeavors
to maintain more thah one wife. There are occasional desertions
by husband or by wife; an occasional case of assault and battery;
and during the year two cases of constitutional rape have come

to our attention. Our laws are ample and, so far as we are aware,
well enforced, altho there are sections of the jurisdiction, far
removed from headquarters, concerning which we have little ac-
tual information. All crimes and misdemeanors, eXcept those of
a more serious nature, are tried by the Indian Court. rhis Court
sits on the last day of each month and continues in session until
all matters brought before it are disposed of. This usually
requires part of two days with an occasional little "hang-over"
into the third day. This Court sits at Agency headquarters and
consists pf two Indian Judges, the entire Police force, with_

the Superintendent presiding. Everything is done methodically and
in order and with the greatest decorum. The cases are considered
one at a time, witnesses are examined hy the Judges, byr the
Police, and by the Superintendent, and decisions reached, based
upon evidence presented. Altho everything is formal and in order,
any one present is allowed and invited to speak, and the decisions

reached are usually satisfactory even to the interested parties.

Sentences running as high as so days in the Agency guard-house,

at hard labor, are imposed and served. It is almost never necessa-
ry to lock up a prisoner. He is simply directed to remain at the

Agency jail for the period of his sentence and has his duties

Section ll. ------- Health.

The health of both pupils and employees at the San
Juan School and Agency has been reasonably good through-out the
year. There were a few cases of Typhoid in November and December,
however, nothing serious, and the chlorinating of the water,
by means of a simple, home-made contrivance nipped in the bud
what might have been a serious epidemic.

Measles were rampant at the Toadlena School for a couple

of months in the spring. Nearly every child in the school was

down. The weather was warma and other conditions favorable and

there was but one fatality. much credit is due Dr. James D. Kennedy,
and Principal W. H. Hashbarger and his Assistants.

A_Biphtheria epidemic broke out in September at Dene
Hot So, 100 mines west of Shiprock. However, as we happened to
have in the vault a quantity of the proper Vaccine, the Agency
Physician visited the locality and treated every member of the
. community. Several deaths occurred before the matter was.called to
our attention, and several individuals were very sick when the
Physician arrived en the scene. However, but one death occurred
after the arrival of the Doctor with the serum. Several months
later one case of Diphtheria broke out at Shiprock, but the prompt
use of the vaccine saved-the life of the afflicted infant and
prevented the spread of the disease.

assigned. He serves his time; performs the tasks assigned;
comes to the office and shakes hands with the Superintendent,
assuring him that thereafter there will be no violations by
Ihim of rules and regulations; and takes his departure. Each
Court day usually produces one presoner, sometimes more, occasion-
ally five or six. When the prisoner happens to be a woman, the
difficulties are somewhat increased. Under such conditions the
prisoner is assigned to the Agency hospital or to the weaving
room, where duties are assigned.

Eractically the only dances indulged in by the San Juan
Navajo take the form of prayers for rain or are a portion of the
treatment given the sick by the Medicine Hen. Locally, they are
called "sings", and usually are of short duration. They are not
permitted to interfere with the care of the flecks. In fact, the
one thing always of paramount importance with the San Juan Navajo
is the care of the flock and nothing is permitted to interfere
with this care.

During the past year there have been fewer divorces
'and‘more ceremonial marriages than during the preceding year. I
am unable to account for this. Yet the fact remains that several
couples from outlying points on the reservation have secured
marriage licenses from the County Clerk} through the Superintend-

ent, and have been formally married by the.local Missionary. I

do not intend to imply that the total has reached any large number,

however, there have been upward of; a score of these marriages
during the year.

The spiritual need of these people is cared for by
representatives of different denominations. Fifty miles west of
Shiprock, in the heart of the desert, dwell the Holc0mb family,
representatives of a sect calling themselves the "Bretheren".
The family consists of the Rev. H. A. Holcomb and his wife,
both aged people; their unmarried daughter, Clara; a married
daughter, together with her husband and baby; and a graduate
nurse, Miss Barker. They live where few white people would

consent to live and as few white people could exist. Bast winter,

with the mercury far below zero, in the d ad of night, the wind
tore the roof completely from theih‘humbzz dwelling. After offering

thanks to God for sparing their lives, they removed to the adjoin-

ing cow—shed, which they continued to share with the cow until

such time as a new roof could be purchased and put in place. These
people are Missionaries, servants of the Most High. At Tes Nos Pos,
50 miles west of Shiprock, the Rev. and hrs. Abney dwell, repre-
senting the Presbyterian Church in that locality. They have a little
chapel, a dwelling house for themselves and a dwelling for their
interpreter and his family. At Red Rocks, 50 miles south west of
Shiprock, the Presbyterian Church maintains a hospital, a well-
equipped, well-furnished building, with residences for Physician

and his interpreter. Dr. Thomas Snoddy and his wife are in charge.

The dourse of Study in so far as it applies
to the gaades taught here, has been very careful-
ly and thoroughly carried out both in the academic
and in the induStrial and domestic departments.

The book supplies have been well suited to
the needs of the pupils. No change is suggested.
Daily outlines are prepared and followed.

Girls are instructed in Home Training, Cook—
ing, Sewing, Laundry work, Poultry raising, and
Weaving.

Boys are instructed in Engineering, Farming,
Gardening, Poultry rassing, Animal Husbandry,

Goat Dairying, and Shoe Repair work. The school
has neither a carpenter nor a blacksmith.

The instruction for both boys and girls is
based on the Course of Study for the above in-
dustries. Regular lessons four days each week.
much time has of necessity been devoted to vo~
cahulary work in the early'part of the year as
all pupils are of the primary grades.

The School is equipped with a modern central
heating plant which will be able to cover the in-
creaded capacity without any additions. Excellent
Light and water systems already in use will be
adequate for the needs of the additional capac-
ity withour further expense. Water is supplied by
gravity flow, it is pure and ample for domestic
purposes.

A concrete floor has been added to the base-
ment of the school building during the year, all
work being done by the school force without any,
extra expense of any kind. This provides an ample
room for gymnasium purposes. Also a small two—room
cottage finished with compo board was erected by
school employees and pupils. There was no extra
expense'incurred in the construction of same. This
was an inexpensive type of construction and pro-
vided and excellent lesson to the older boys. It
also provided quarters for one married employee
and family.

A number of buildings have been roofed k W” ;
during_the year. The Mangle transferred from the '
Ft. Simcoe School, Yakima, Washington, has been in-
stalled and is giving good service..Prior to the
installation of this machine we were without a man-
gle of any kind. . . ‘

There haVe been a few cases of Measles in the camps
but it by no means amnunted to an epidemic, and I have heard
of no deaths resulting.
Possibly for the first time in the history of the San
Juan jurisdiction there has been lumber available for sale to
Indians. This lumber was fabricated at the saw mill located an
the mountain above Toadlena, and altho the supply was not equal
to the demand, upward of 100,000 feet were sold. Another supply
will soon be available and, before the close of the year which
we are about to enter, we hope and expect to be able to supply
the demand. This means better homes and better irrigation structures.
There are but two Physicians, in the employ of the
Government, stationed on this jurisdiction, and these men necessar-
ily spend by far the greater portion of their time close to their
reapective stations. This leaves the greater portion of the reser-
vation to the ministrations of the Medicine Man who thrives
wonderfully. In fact this Medicine Man is a truly marvelous per-
son. He not only controls the evil spirits, that are responsible
for all diaease, but even the wind and the rain, the thunder
and the lightning are likewise his servants. This is really too
bad for the Navajo takes kindly to the medicines and treatment
of the white Physician, and, were white Physicians-available, I

am inclined to believe the influence of the Medicine Man, now the

strongest influence on the reservation, would be tremendously reduced.;:

I desire to recommend that more potable
drinking water be obtained for the Agency and
school district.

Dr. John D. Kennedy of the Toadlena School, who has had

many years of‘service among the Navajo Indian submits the following:-

The general health conditions at the school
and in the community were very good until a mild
attack of influenza came on followed by an epidemic
of measles which effects are not entirely over.

About January a mild attack of influenza came
on, some of the children were quite sick, while
others were only slightly so, following this in-
fection the measles came on, first in the Indian
homes, and later appeared in the school. Practically
all of the children were afflicted; one employee;
her child; the child of the Principal; three children
of the Disciplinarian, one of whom died; one child
of the Shoemaker; one of the Girls' Matron; and eleven
cases on the outside, ten Indians and one white, one
school girl also died.

VThe general sanitary condition in and around.
the fndian homes seems to be improving to some '
extent in the way of cleanliness of person and in
the surroundings, but it will be a long time yet
to be especially noticeable to the casual observer.

(a) Some new log houses and hogans have been
erected with windows and doors in the houses; dishes,
and modern cooking utensils are more in demand than
formerly, with stoves, chairs, sewing machines, etc.
to complete the furnishings of the homes. There has
been no regular sanitary inspection.

(b) At our school we are in need of a goOd large
hospital to accommodate the growing school, two hun-
dred pupils as well as many in the 00mmunity who are
anxious to receive medical treatment, especially
is this true in epidemics of measles, influenza, etc.

(c) There are no steps being taken to handle
tuberculosis only as cases appear and we are notified
to see them do we know anything about them. If feasi-
ble we recommend their removal to the Sanitarium
at Forte Defiance, Arizona, or take them there our-
selves. Regarding trachoma the Government has made
an appropriation for the treatment of the J-ndians
in general which is done largely during the school
vacation. '

It might be practicable to establish temporary
tent hOSpitals for the treatment of adults and children

Comparatively nothing is being done to combat Tuber-
culosis. Odcasionally a case tomes to the Agency Hospital but only

rarely. In fact Tubercular patients are not made to feel partic-

ularly welcome at the HOSpital for the reason there is so much

work of other natures continually coming in.

VA very energetic effort is continually being made to
control Trachoma in our schools, and Dr. Wigglesworth, Special
Physician, who spent several weeks with us in late spring and
early summer, advised that less than 20% of the pupils in our
schools are afflicted. The Doctor stated further that this places
these schools at the head of the Navajo schools. Yet 20% Trachoma
is appalling. Up to the present time nothing has been done to com-
bat Trachoma on the reservation nor have we any means of knowing
to what extent Trachoma is_prevalent among the Indians of the
jurisdiction.

I have stated that nothing is being done to combat either
Tuberculosis or Trachoma on the San Juan reservation, outside the
Schools, but I do not desire to convey the idea or leave the im-
pression that this condition is the result of carelessness or in—
difference. The Physician, located at Shiprock, is located there
in about the same sense that the Hospital is. Had he an Assistant
'to take charge of the local work he could get out on the reservation
but, as it is, he is practically fixed. The Physician located at

Toadlena gets out more but is able to cover only a very small area.

To day we have growing on this farm

101 acres of alfalfa (old),

25 acres of alfalfa (new),

ll acres of pinto beans,.

79 acres of field corn,

50 acres of garden stuffs.
In the garden we are growing nearly everything that can be pro—
duced in this climate but are placing particular emphasis upon
Sweet Corn, Tomatoes, Cabbage, Squash. This fall we expect to dry
over two tons of corn, two tone of the dehydrated product. This
means many tons of green corn as it comes from the garden and is
about twice the amount we dried last fall. We expect to dry
sufficient squash to subsist both the San Juan and the Mesa
Schools. we expect to produce sufficient beans to subsist the
two schools named above plus the Illoadlena School; enpugh tomatoes
to subsist the three schools, last year we cannedz ,OOO half
gal. jars of tomatoes for the San Juan School and this year pro-
pose to put up at least twice that quantity. We also expect to
produce sufficient cabbage to subsist both schools. These crops
are in the ground and the promise so far is good. It promises to
be a banner year on the San Juan School farm and garden.

of "flu" followed by an epidemic of measles in which practically
every child participated. However, there was but one fatality.

(b) We prOpose to make it possible for them to con-
Serve in reservoirs (tanks) some of the flood waters so that
they may have water both for stock and irrigation purposes even
after the Spring floods haVe subsided. As it is to-day, and as
it always has been, 90% of the privately-owned ditches totally
lack water as soon as the snows have disappeared from the hills.
As yet we have no means of knowing how many reservoirs of this
character may be built but are certain that several at least
are capable of construction, and, when the work is once started,
it may deve10p> that possible sites are numerous. Nothing has
been attempted along this line as yet.

a man was employed at this task from May until inclement weather
in the fall made it impossible to prosecute the work further.

He develOped eighteen springs. It was my most earnest desire
that this work be continued this'season but lack of funds, I am
advised, prevented. This work is being done under the supervision
of the irrigation Branch of the Service and of course it cannot
assume the impnntance with them that it does with those of us
that are on the reservation every day, and every day forcibly
reminded of the terrible condition existing. It is by far the
most important work as yet undertaken on this jurisdiction and
certainly nothing should be permitted to interfere with its.
vigorous and continued prosecution. I believe: there are hundreds

At Toadlena, the Chirstian Reformed Church maintains a
Missionary and a Public School, under the management of the
Rev. L. P. Brink. Their buildings consist of residences for the
Missionary and his Interpreter, and a small house for the Public
School. At Shiprock, the Presbyterian Church has a Chapel and is

nearly a decade. The Church provides an Assistant and an Inter-
preter.

The liquor question causes no uneasiness whatever.
During the period of my administration I have seen no Indian
under the influence of liquor. They do not manufacture it or seek
it. Peyote is unknown and unheard of on the jurisdiction.

The fact that money is so scarce and so difficult to
Secure tends to reduce gambling to a minimum. When an Indian
needs money so badly that he will skin a goat and carry the pelt
from 20 to 50 miles and there sell it for from 15¢ to 25¢ he is

much more inclined to spend this money for food-stuffs than he is

to risk it on the turn pf a card. Gambling is unpopular and is

not indulged in to any appreciable extent.

counted the capacity would be two hundred. During
the year we have'enrolled two hundred and thirty
children and have had an average attendance of
over two hundred and fifteen. The Mesa School now
nearing completion at Shiprock, will take care of
two hundred children. There is an Indian Mission
near Farmington, called the Navajo Industrial
School which has a capacity of about fifty.

A new beiler has been secured to replace one
of the two new in use. The boiler which is to be removed
is in Very bad condition and is dangerous.

The bake oven which was in very bad condition
was torn down and rebuilt and is nwo giving satis-
factory service.

A new extractor and washer have been added to
the Laundry equipment.

The acreage of the school farm has been de-~
creasing each year because there has been no
drainage system of merit. There is a tile drainage
system but it is completely filled with sand. This
spring an open ditch was made across one section of
the farm and another across the garden and these
ditches are carrying a great deal of ground water
all the time.

Several new farm implements should be purchased
for the school. There is immediate need of a new
disc harrow, a one row corn drill, and hay rakes.

There is no position established fer a dining
room Matron at this school. During the present school
year various assistants have been detailed to take
charge of the dining room work. The position of
Dining Room Matron should be established, as it is
necessary that there be a woman in the dining room
who understands the care of food, sanitation, and
who can instruct the children in table manners and
other conduct required. Also, such a woman would
prevent waste and instruct the girls in cooking.

The children who graduate from this school and
are physically fit are transferred to non-reserva-
tion schools. The graduates are usually very willing
to transfer. When the Mesa School is opened, the
seventh and eighth grades should be added to the San
Juan School.

The morals of the Indians are very good. Many of
the Indians are marrying according to established
laws and are making homes according to our ways and
customs. The Indians of this reservation are industrious.

There should be at least one more Physician just to care for work
other than Tuberculosis and Trachoma in the camps. Then, too,

there is a crying need of a Tuberculosis Sanitarium. It is a matter
for tears to see some of these people seeking help and so sadly
needing it yet unable to find a place where help may be had.

The present Hospital, a general hOSpital, is full prac-
tically all the time, and, were our Physician a Surgeon as well as
a Physician, it would be filled with surgical cases a goodly por-
tion of the time. Should an additional Physician be supplied, or
should it become advisable to change the present incumbent, care
should be taken to secure the services of a practical Surgeon.

There is very little venereal disease among these Indians
and, when a case appears, they hasten to inform the Superintendent
and have it properly treated. There are Indian Medicine Men who
claim to be able to treat these diseases successfully, but blood
tests taken of "chred" patients have convinced us, as well as most
of the Indians, that the so-called "cures" are not free from the
disease; 5

There are no Field Matrons on the jurisdiction and I

am not prepared to recommend the creation of such positions, as

Conditions are by no means favorable for their operation.

of these springs and Seeps that are now producing only a very_
small percentage of the water of which they are capable under
prOper develOpment. many of them are marked by numerous car-
casses of animals that have comeJin an effort to secure water
and, because of their Weakened condition, have bogged down and
died. Last spring I personally saw nine head of horses, either
dead or dying, half buried in one of these springs. They should
have been developed long ago, and certainly it is a pity that
this work must be longer delayed. 'By the plan under which they
were being develOped last season, not only is the flow of water
greatly increased but also the condition is changed from that
described above into one where clear water, fit for human con-
sumption,is always available and where cattle, horses, and sheep
may acme and secure water without danger to their lives. I would.
like to see this work prosecuted with persistence and vigor,.

farm which is located some eight miles from the
school on the mountains. There are many advantages
in the present selection of a school farm. The
soil is rich. Irrigation is not.generally neCessary
and never possible..There is no initial expense for
the purchase of the land. The land is free from.
stone, brush, stumps, and trees. Thirty acres have
already been fenced. It is planned to erect an in-
expensive house of logs during the present season
for the occupancy of the laborer. This work is done
without any allotment of funds for the purpose. The
Laborer and one team will be stationed at the farm
from seed time to the completion of-the harvest in
the fall. Additional help will be provided for the
seeding and the harvest, mostly employees and per-
haps some pupils but few of the latter. The laborer
will cultiVate at the proper time in order to keep
down weeds and to make the best use of the moisture.
At other-times he will break additional sod, improve
the land already fenced, and cut posts for further
fencing. There is possibly a section of available
land in this tract. '

The°school garden, located at the school, and
which has been very productive in the past will be
utilized to the-fullest ectent possible with the
limited water available foriirrigation. also small
plots of alfalfa. Also a little sweet corn and pop
corn raised by dry farming methods.

available for sleeping porches to increase the capac-

Annual Report, 1925. San Juan Agency.

Dr. M. M. Carmichael of Shiprock writes as follows:-

General health conditions at the school and
Agency are good, considering that the present water
supply for drinking purposes is not good.

We have had a small epidemic among the Indian
school children of "chicken pox" which was not serious.
The general sanitary conditions of the reser-

vation are fairly good every place I have visited.
Where has been no regular sanitary inepection made.

I think that Indian Field Matrons could do more to
improve conditions by visiting the homes of the
Indians and teaching them, eSpecially the women,

the proper modes of cleanliness and sanitation; to
teach and explain that the best place for the proper
care of the sick is the hospital, of which we have

a good one and no Nurse superior to ours. Advice
given by myself on the reservation regarding Tuber-
culosis is ppenty of sunshine and fresh air, milk and
eggs diet. I do not think it practicable to estab~
lish tent hospitals unless we had nurses to place

in charge of them for the special care and work alone.
I do 1 think tent hospitals would be the proper

and mos t adequate establishments for the treatment

of Tuberculosis if we had nurses for that special
work. I always advise the Indians the importance of
allowing me xi‘to treat them for Trachoma.

I have had no known cases of Venereal diseases
to come to my knowledge since I have been here, but
had one suspected case. I have no plans for a cam-
paign against these diseases but will do so if you
suggest.

I am not conversant with the Medical work of
the past here owing to being here only a short time
but I can see nothing left undone that should have
been done and everything accomplished that should
have been. I assure you I will maintain the title
of a worker.and fighter or Phagocite against bac—
teria as long as 1 remain here.

The territory here is rather large for only
one physician, however I am willing and asxious to
do all I can, answer every call etc. I like to keep
busy 0 .
I understand your feference "to reach the women"
is regarding their child births- I have often and am
always explaining that it is very important that the
"white Medical Doctor" be allowed to attend them.

Field Matrons can do good work with a woman I think.

weave rugs which bring a good price at the
Traders. A great many of the young educa-
ted Indians are employed in the schools.

There are children of school age on
the reservation, but these will be placed in
school in the Fall when the Mess school is
opened and it is thought there will be very
few children left on the resesvation, who
are of school age. In some cases it is necessary
that a child of school age be left in the camp
as the parents are dependent upon them for help.

The retnnned students as a rule are Very
fine young men and women and are Willing to
better their condition. Some of these are em-
ployed in the schools and others are assisted
in finding employment in different sections
of the country. '

The Course of Study is being followed and
the daily lesson plans are prepared. The school-
room equipment is not satisfactory..There is need
of new desks, new and up to date maps and other
minor equipment.

The boys are given instruction in Carpentny,
-Blacksmithing, Farming, Gardning, Dairying,"
Painting, and Shoe and Harness Making. The boys
doing work in the Industrial Departments, work
in the departments.half of each day and go to
school the other half. They are given one hour'of
industrial class work before the work for the day
begins. This instruction consists of explana-
tion of tools used, the reasons for such use and
lessons on the various kinds of work they are doing.

. The girls are given instruction in the Laundry,
Sewing Room, Weaving_Room, Bakery, and Kitchen.
The instruction is handled in the same manner as
that of the boys. , , _ ' .
V The reservation Indians do not come in con-
tact with a great many white people. Most of
their dealings are with the Government employees,
missionaries, and Indian Traders.

We have no play-ground equipment worth men—
tioning. The teachers and assistant disciplinarian
have supervised the work on the playground this
year and it has been very difficult because of
the need of more equipment.

and also for instruction for children not in
school, provided they would be used in weather
that is suitable, e. g., spring, summer, and
part of the autumn.

We have no hospital as yet, one has been
requested and the inspector gave favorable re-
port concerning it.

No cases of venereal disease have come to
my knowdedge during the year.

There have been more requests for medical
attention in the Indian homes than in any pre-
vious year while I have been at this station,
and more requests for heapital care and treat-
ment. We have gone out to see quite a number at
some distance since we have had the use of the
automobile and if time had made it possible we
would have seen more. I regret not to hays tab—
ulated the number of cases treated as-has been
done heretofore in the school and in the commu-
nity but I have been pressed for time that it
has been difficult to have all things done as 7-
we would like to have them done.

The most ur1ent needs for carrying on the
medical and health work on our part of the Res-
ervation and at the school is a school and res-
ervation hospital and also a Sanitarium and more
employees; e. 3., another physician and a field
nurse to treat those who need treatment on the .
outside and canvass our district to know the ex-
act state of health in the indian homes. A trained
nurse should be employed at the school hospital
and one at the Sanitarium with the assistance of
such other nurses as may be needed. It is a mis-
take to take tuberculous patients at a general
hospital especially among Indians whose suscep-
tibility is marked.

Where have been no special methods to reach
Indian women. When they have shown a desire for'
treatment we have recommended hospital treatment
and have taken means to have them sent thither.

Fiend matrons under the direction of a phy—
sician may and can do good work, but my opinion
is that they can do more good in improving the so-

cial conditions of the Indians than in the field
of medicine.

girls who are now mothers all the literature I can

A hOSpital is urgently needed for the use

One hundred and thmtty cases of measles among

One or better two cottages are needed for

ucational both for the pupils and for the adults
of this community. It is thought that films

expense and once each month by donations from '
employees and others. Current is available. A
good hall is already available.

Generally speaking employees are efficient
and loyal. Co—operation and co-ordination have
been good on the whole. Attention is called to the
unusually efficient Physician, Head Matron, and
Senior Teacher (Miss Clinesmith).

4 In some cases accommodations for employees
are limited. Sometimes two or more employees are
quartered in one room.

The school has adapted itselfko the needs of
the Indian in the matter of a goat dairy. This is
a phase of Navajo industry that has in the past
perhaps been neglected in favor of the sheep in—
dustry. .However, it is an important factor in
the economic independence of the Navajo. The
School hopes to help its patrons both by example
and by having a well cared for flock of Toggen-
berg milch gOats and in being able to supply them
with male goats so they will be enabled to breed
up their herds for better milk production.

Also in the matter of using the land on the
mountain for the production of potatoes and hay
the school has taken the lead and there are al-
ready indications that a number of the younger
Navajos will follow the lead of the school.

’ We wish also to make mention of the efforts
of our reservation authorities which have made
possible the operation of a Government saw mill

Section III --—-Schools..

The.San Juan Boarding School has finished a most suc-
cessful year. The pupils have been healthy and happy, no serious
sickness, not a single desertion, and the Academic Department
has operated efficiently through-out the year. While the health
of the employees has not been so good, there has been no serious
illness. Altho the winter was unusually severe we experienced no
difficulty in keeping the buildings comfortable.

' At Shiprock there is a considerable farm and garden
which we attempt to utilize to the utmost. Ignorant and wasteful
methods in the application of irrigation water, together with
a total lack of provision for drainage, has caused a large portion
of this area to become swampy. This year we have completed two
open drain ditches which will tend to overcome this condition.
One of these ditches was completed in March and has been carrying
a large head of water ever since and apparently will continue to
do so for some time to come._ This ditch is 5,505 feet in lenght
and is from 4% to 6% feet deep. It drains a large acreage. In .
fact its existence made it possible to seed some 60 acres this
year that has not been used for upward of ten years. The second
ditch was completed late in June. It is slightly over 4,000 feet
in length and from 3% to 4% feet deep. It too is carrying a large

head of water with no apparent lessening in volume. These two

ditches, if kept open, will do much to reclaim the San Juan School

task'of draining is 2/53 completed.

The promise of bountiful harvests on the School farm

and garden is far better to—day than it was a year ago. on: the
San Juan School farm there is growing
101 acres of alfalfa (old),
25 acres of alfalfa (new),
11 acres of pinto beans,
79 acres of field corn,
50 acres of garden stuffs.
In the garden we are growing practically everything
that can be produced in this climate but are stressing particularly
sweet corn, squash, tomatoes, and cabbage. For the past two years
we have dried over a ton of sweet corn at this school. This year
as we have the Mesa School to subsist, as well as the San Juan
School, we shall endeavor to dry at least double that amount.
This means a tremendous amount of the green ears. We expect also
to dry squash sufficient for both schools and to can over 4,000
half gal. jars of tomatoes. We will also produce sufficient
cabbage to subsist both institutions. The promise so far is excellent.
At the Toadlena School, 40 miles south of Shiprock, I
we have a garden that will supply every vegetable need of the
_ school, in so far as it can be prodused in that altitude.this
garden is limited only by the supply of water available for irr-
gation purposes. On the t0p of the mountain, eight miles above—
this school, we have in 18 acres of potatoes in an effort to

produce potatoes sufficient for our three schools. At the present

writing the prosPect is very assuring andee confidently expect

to make 100 tons at least of potatoes. The chief difficulty lies

The liquor question does not seriously affect us. The
Superintendent has not seen a drunken Navajo in the three
years of his incumbency. This does not necessarily mean that
none of them indulge in intoxicants when it may be had, but
it does indicate that such indulgence must of necessity be
very limited. These Indians make no intoxicating beverages
or preparations and peyote is wholly unknown to them. Neither
do they purchase proprietary medicines or extracts for beverage
purposes. '

The Navajo is not a gambler. where money is as scarce
and as hard to secure as it is on the San duan jurisdiction,
there is little danger that any large amounts will be hazarded
upon the turn of a card. They do have Sunday horse-racing
but the betting is usually limited to from ten cents to a
quarter. The rambling situation is by no Means serious.

There have been several good rains in that lecality and the

- excellent
prospects are/for a good yield. If weather conditions continue

favorable we should harvest not less than one hundred tons.
This is a big undertaking for the tract of land is very hard

of access. A team of horsas cannot make more than one round
trip per day and cannot handle in excess of a ton per trip.

By a team I mean four horses. So a banner crOp of potatoes
this coming fall means some work getting them down to Toadlena.
In addition to these potatoes the Principal at Toadlena will
produce sufficient ruta bagas and sufficient cabbage to subsist
his school. We eXpect to use the potatoes produced,at the three
schools and to produce enough to subsist all three of these
schools.

I have asked the Principals of these schools to prepare
for this Report a short review of the year's work at their re—
spective schools.

Principal Frank I. Inloes of the San Juan Boarding
School writes as follows:-

There is a Public School at Shiprock. During the
past year three Indian children were enrolled in
this school. These children were all promoted at
the close of the school term. The school building
is very small and it would be impossible to enrmll
Iother Indian children. ‘

.The San Juan Boarding school has a capacity

of one hundred and eighty pupils. however, there
are several small cottages in use and if these were

the existence of any reservation influence that is seriously
opposed to the hospital. It is true that Indians fear a house
in which a person has died, and Havajos are no exception to
this rule, but I note that this does not prevent them from
bringing to the.hospital such patients as they desire to bring
in. Of course the influence of some of the medicien men is
opposed to the hospital and to the ministrations of the white
physician, but not more so than it is ppposed to the schools
and to everything else that tends to elevate and civilize

the Indians.

There is incorporated herewith a report from Dr. James
D. Kennedy, who has been with the Havajos for a great many
years, and who for the past four years has been employed at
the Toadlena BOarding School, where he attends to the needs
of the school and as much of the reservation as he is able
to reach. He is active and conscientious and familiar with
conditions. The report follows.

The general health of school and Agency
has been good. The children have been able to
attend school the major part of the time and
as far as I am able to judge the health con-
dition is rather in advance of former years.

During the year there have been epidemics
in the school and community of mumps,'chicken
pox, measles, and influenza. Measles very nearly
ran its course in this part of the reservation
during the year 1924-25. During the year we have
had 66 cases of mumps, 51 cases of chicken pox,
and 150 cases ct influenza. In the community
we have responded to calls when our attention
has been called to the need and many have come
to the dispensary and requested treatment or
asked for medicines. -

The general sanitary conditions of the res-
ervation and around the Indian homes has been
improving from year to year. As I am writing
this an Indian woman called for medicine and I
put the question to her. She is a returned student
who has lived in this community for many years
and she knows conditions well, both present and
former,.and she fully concurs in'the above state-
ment that conditions in the home and on the res-
ervation are continually improving.

There has been no regular sanitary inspection
nor any special work done in this direction as
it would be impossible with the present force of
employees, which is limited to myself, to do much

About 150 different Indians secured portions of the mixture and
applied it to their fields, most of them reporting a reasonable
degree of success, altho some appear to have found it lacking in
potency and in these instances it appears that the Indians
kept the mixture for several days before applying it and in all
probability it soured. It is somewhat early in the season to
determine final results. However, it is our opinion the treat-
ment as a whole was a decided success. we are very grateful to
the Bruce M. Barnard Co. for their part in this undertaking.
No change has been made in the manner of adninistra-
tion of the lands under the Hogbach Ditch. Ho allotments have
been made. The area is sub-divided into ten-acre tracts which

are used by some 150 different families. The majority of these

families actually reside under the ditch for only a portion of

the farming season. In fact even then only certain members of

the family so reside the other members being on the desert with

Industry. A great deal of credit‘ is due Stockman Jensen, and
Dr. H. E. Pine of Aztec, H. M. for the present excellent condi~

tion of the sheep of the jurisdiction both as to their freedom

from scabbies and as to the rapid manner in which the quality

of the flocks as improving. Particularyy is Jensen resPonsible
for these happy conditions.

The sheep wintered well in spite of unusual cold and
snow in December and January. For a time it looked as though there~
must necessarily be a tremendous_death loss. In fact some intelli-
gent people advocated selling some of the she stuff. But the winter
broke with the last day of January and the flocks came through
with but normal loss. I

Little is known of the cattle of this jurisdiction. No
sales have been made during the year other than those made to
supply a very limited local demand. No new blood has been intro-
duced for years and years, if ever, and the cattle are distinctively
a mongrel lot. All beef for the San Juan School and Hospital,
was bought direct from Indians througheout the year and the quality
of beef and the service were equal to the best. Pure bred Hereford
bulls should be introduced but first there must be a better demand
for beef. There are many five and six year old steers on this
reservation, held simply for lack of market. Possibly the day is
not so far off when beef animals will once more show a profit and

-until that day I expect we must get along as we have in the.past.

thus enabling the Navajo to purchase lumber
at cost of manufacture with which to improve
their homes and their irrigation flumes and
headgates. This is something that has long
been needed and the Navajos are very grate-
ful for this effort on their behalf. They

are quite willing to buy or work for the lumber.
All they have needed was the opportunity to
buy lumber near at home at reasonable cost.
The effects for good will be far reaching and
the full benefit cannot be estimated in money.

Good use is being made of home4made play-
ground equipment. '

Systematic supervision to play-ground
activities is being given by the Disoiplin~
arian. '

Girls are provided one swing, teeters,
basket ball and volley ball courts, and one
croquet set and make good use of them;

It will probably be necessary to continue
the Government school here for at least another
generation. There are few whites and almost no
tax—paying Indians therefore if the Navajo are
-to be educated it will be necessary to do so at
Federal expense.

' Telephone connection between the office of
the Superintendent at Shiprock and this school
is urgently needed. The distance is 42 mileS.

to become water-logged. This, if unchecked, means the
ruination of the farm and garden and the death of all
vegetation. Last year two open ditches were constructed
and these are apparently operating fairly successfully.
Many acres, which for the past 10 or 12 years have been
considered waste, have been partially reclaimed and are
now producing crops or partial crops. I do not believe
that the ditches dug last year will susceed in solving
the problem. It is my opinion that they will haVe to be
extended somewhat.

The first and third of the above mentioned needs

are apparent to even a casual Observer, for they cause
the San Juan school to present at all times an unfavorable
appearance,- with toilet fixtures out of order, faucets
leaking, sewers plugged, water—heaters out of commission,
and with either mud or unthinkably mineralized water coming
from the faucet every time it is opened, with half the
farm and half the garden barren because of excess water,
with vegetation, trees and shrubbery dying, the place
presents at all times an appearance of neglect, of having
seen its best days, and these appearances will not im-
prove until these two handicaps have been removed. We
confidently believe we are on the road to betterment. We
believe the large reservoir mentioned above will ulti-
mately prove a success, that its leaks can be stopped,
that a suitable filter can be installed, and that some
arrangement can be devised to render the water bacteria-
logically harmless. We know that the two open ditches
,have lowered the water table in large tracts of land,

and believe that these ditches if properly extended and
cared for will reclaim the entire area of the school farm
and garden.

The second of the above mentioned needs,- protection
from the San Juan River flood-waters, is not so appearant
to the casual observer. However, these possible floods
constitute an ever present danger'and cause the Superin-
tendent many anxious moments, and, as-has been stated
nothing is being done to relieve the condition.

Two additional class-rooms and a gymnasium are needed
at the San Juan School, together with additional play-
' ground equipment. We_pr0pose, with the approval of the
Indian Office, to erect a frame building that will provide
the cases-rooms and the gym. and this without much expen-
diture of funds as the lumber will be fabricated in the

Agency saw~mill. The plaT-ground aparatus will be purchased

All that is known about the ponies of the reservation
is that there are far too many of them anﬁsidering their
worthlessness and that talking will never reduce their number.

It is my opinion, and the opinion of some of the best minds among

the Indians, that a limit should be placed upon the amount for

free range any one NaVajo may possess himself of; that cattle

and horses should be'expressed in terms of sheep and a fee col—
lected for all animals owned by an individual in excess of a
.stated number. In this manner possibly the Navajo might be ed-
ucated to look with less favor upon his worthless ponies.

The Navajos do not milk cows but do milk goats to a
considerable degree. Navajos are natural milk drinkers. During
the past year, the dairy connected with the San Juan School has
produced an average of approximately 400 pounds of milk per day
and it has all been consumed by the pupils. They like milk and
are the only Indian peeple I have.met that do like it.

The Toggenberg goat herd, at the Toadlena Schbbl, is
shaping up fine. Within the nekt ten years this herd should be
making all the milk that school can consume plus a goodly por-
tion of the meat. We shall soon find it necessary to procure
a sire to head the flock. we expect also to use the male animals
from this herd to effect a change in the type of gOats owned by
the Indians, a change from the Angora type to a Milk type.

At the San Juan School we have diSposed of most of the

Annual Report, 1925. San Juan Agency.
-N_ARRATIVE SECTIONS
Section IV ---Industries.

We have a very definite pregram of industrial advance
ment:- .

V '(a) we propose to operate a saw mill and operate it in
such a manner that lumber may be procured by all needing it with
no eXpense to the consumer other than the expense of labor. This
enables all NaVajos that wish to do so to abandon the much con-
demned type of'dwelling they now occupy, the Hogan. It will en-
able them to substitute wooden structures for the sand and brush
structures now in use in their privately-owned irrigation ditches.
In fact this feature of our program has already been inaugurated.
Last summer and fall two men were kept'busy in the forest pre—
paring logs for the mill yard. Later in the fall, when the work
of the season had been completed on the farm, two farm teams, one
from the Toadlena School and one from the San Juan School, were
sent to the forest to place these logs in the mill yard, approx—
imately 100,000 feet were thus handled. The lumber was fabrica-
ted in February and March, and, as soon as it was placed on
the market, the Navajos were after it in large numbers so that
the available supply was soon exhausted. To day we are repeating

the process. As these Indians have never before had access to

lumber, it would appear that the demand will be rather great

and it may take us some time to catch up with it. However, barring

misfortune, we will ultimately arrive at that point.

condition no longer exists. They want to dip and insist upon
dipping. One old woman, living near Toadlena, scolded the
Superintendent for not dipping her sheep, and, when advised
that her sheep were free from scabbies and consequently did not
head dipping, replied that they all had colds and she wanted
them dipped to cure them. Wherever I went there was the same
complaint. They wanted to dip. The truth is the jurisdiction is
practically free from scabbies. Dr. Henry Pine, local representa-
tive of the Bureau of Animal Industry, and Agency Stockman, Sophus
Jensen, together personally inspected every lamb sold from the
jurisdiction last fall and found no trace of the disease. These
lambs represented every flock of the jurisdiction, large and small,
and the result of the examination was very gratifying. In November
scabbies appeared in two widely separated flocks and was premptly
treated. In both instances the disease was traced to animals
purchased and imported from points beyond out boundaries.

Lice are giving us far more trouble than scabbies.
Through-out November and December Stockman Jensen was busy dipping

for lice using Kreso No. 1. This work was halted by severe winter

weather. However, the preparation was tested sufficiently ﬁto

demonstrate its efficQQMe; and we are planning a general dipping
this fall using this coal tar preparation. In this manner we
hope to control the lice that have been giving so much trouble

of late years. The plan has the approval of the Bureau of Animal

will necessitate the employment of at least

two additional teachers. Class rooms will be
available. Also school furniture. This will
make five teachers for two hundred pupils or

at the rate of one teacher to every forty pu-
pils. This is not too many in view of the fact
that all pupils at present are in the Beginners,
First, and Second Grades.

Attention is also invited to the fact that
there is not now any employee of the present
force who can be Spared from other duties in
order to do the work'of a Hightwatch. It is
respectfully urged that such a position be
created.

This school has no pupils-above the second
grade therefore there have been no graduates.

Many have been transferred to other schools.

The local public school which has been caring
for a number of NaVajo pupils has had an excellent
year. The teacher, Miss Gouberg, is an excellent
instructor and has the missionary Spirit and has
had a very successful year.

It is thought that there has been a steady
advance made by 0the lndians of this district during
the past year in regard to health, industry, san-
itation, and morals. There has been excellent co-
operation among the agencies for the education,
civilization, and Christianization of the Navajo
during the present fiscal year.*

This school has been caring for ten pupils
more than capacity during the year. School facil—
ities available at Ignacio, and those about to- be-
come available at the Mesa School, at Toadlena,
and at Fort Wingate have been brought to the at-'
tention of the parents so they may be prepared to
supply pupils when the call is made 1'or them. The
supply of available pupils in the camps is becoming'
limited.a1ready.

.This.school has had no incorrigible pupils.

Returned students are doing Well on the whole,
however, they are out of touch with local condi-
tions when they return from the non-reservation
schools. This tends to cause them to drift into
ininerant employment and whatever werk they can find
instead of becoming Sheepmen as do those who have
not attended such schools. There are some returned
students quite successful in the sheep raising
where they have hired others to work for them in
the Care of the sheep. They have their own organi-
zation and are in a better position to take advan—

be nil. With cOrn and mutton the Navajo gets along very well.
Lacking the corn, the diet becomes monotonous. While visiting
a camp last February, I was impressed with the apparent lack

of food-stuffs. In response to my inquiry was advised that they

had plenty of mutton but had been out of corn for about a week.

my interpreter volunteered in all seriousness the following
statement, "The Navajos are never really destitute or hard up.
They always have mutton. But, after eating mutton alone for a
week or ten days, one really ceases to enjoy it" and I quite
agree with him altho I must confess I never tried‘it. Of course,
under the Hogback Ditch, which is operated by the Government,

J

with water diverted from the San uan River, there has been no

shortage of water. The same thing is true under other small ditches,
privately owned, taking water from this same stream. However, not
to exceed 15% of the Indian farms are under the San Juan River
water. Then too under these ditches there has been a terrible
scourge of grasshoppers, consuming every green thing. This

matter came to our attention in May when it became apparent that
the "heppers" were about to take all crops. A conference of in-
terested parties was called at the Agency Office at which con-
ference it was decided to apply poison preparations to the fields.
Licensed Trader Bruce M. Barnard purhhased all materials and

sold them at cost to the Indians; Agency trucks hauled them

from Farmington; and Sophus Jansen, Agency Stockman, took charge

of the preparation and distribution. There were mixed and die—

at least 25% to the capacity of our range.

One most satisfactory thing that has been done, or
rather begun, during the year is the drainage of the San Juan
School farm. Two open ditches have been constructed. One was
begun in February and completed in IViarch . It is 5,505 feet in
length and from 4% to 6% feet deep. The diggers were standing,
in mud and water knee deep through—put the performance and the
ditch had been discharging a large head.of water since it was
half completed and even to—day there is no lessening of volume.
Its existence made it possible to seed approximately 60 acres

that has been idle for the past ten years becausa of its water—

logged condition. Some of our best corn this season is growing

on this re-claimed area. The second ditch was. begun about June

first and completed in mid-June. It is over 4,000 feet in length

and from 5% to 4% feet deep. It is connected in no manner with

ditch No. l but was dug under the same difficulties, the diggers
standing through-out the operation in mud and water from knee to
thigh deep. Both were dug with Navajo labor. 'Ditch No. 2 is just

as effective as is ditch No. 1, and these two ditches, if kept

open, will do much to reclaim the Sann Juan School Eaﬁm and Garden. .
The construction of these two ditches does not necessarily mean

that the draining iof the School farm and garden is completed. In
all probability'latterals, or side ditches, connected with the main

ditches, must be constructed later. However, in our opinion, the

in the inaccessibility of this tract. The road is steep and
”‘Mga.i It takes four head of horses four hours to haul one

ton from the School to the farm and about three hours to re—

turn. Should we produce the yield we expect it will mean some

task to get them down to the school. As yet we have been un-

able to produce hay on this farm in any quantity but are Still
confident and hope within a few years to produce alfalfa hay

in quantities sufficient to subsist a dairy herd at the Toadlena
School. I

There is no great amount ff farming done by the Navajos.

Nevertheless they do attempt to raisa sufficient corn to subsist

their families and to feed a little to their rams during the

winter. The two chief articles of food for a Navajo family are
mutton and corn pone. Ordinarily they raise enough corn for this
purpose but this season, owing to long continued drought, almost
no corn has been planted. The Spring usually brings with it
Spring floods and all arroyos are full of water which they divert
to their corn fields. The past spring brought no floods, the
arroyos carried no water, and consequently the San Juan Havajos
will have no corn this coming winter. The mountains were full

of snow last winter, the fall being unusually heavy, but as it
melted it went into the ground which was bone-dry as a result of
no rains in 1924. This means lack of food for the Havajos next
winter. The corn crop in l924 was short and the 1925 crop will

Annual Report, 1925. I San Juan Agency,

Durhams that formerly constituted a portion of our dairy herd,
and the herd is now almost entirely Holstein. A few choice an-
imals were retained beCause their milk production could be utilized.
As soon as the Holstein herd can be made to produce unaided, milk-
a in quantities sufficient to subsist our schools, these last few

remaining Durhams must go.“

The Holstein Bullecalf secured last year from the hhoenix
Indian School is developing well with a promise of making a much
better animal than our present herd bull.

Last year I reported the Blanket Industry as being the
Navajos' chief source of income. During the year just ending, while
the production of blankets has not fallen off, the amounts received
from the sale of both lambs and wool are increaded to such an extent
as to place each of these items ahead of the Blanket Industry. The
fact that the sheep of the jurisdiction are continually being im-

proved by the introduction of pure bred rams accounts for this in-

creased return from the sale of lambs and wool, the improved lamb

acquires a greater weight before it is placed on the market, and
the improved ewe yields a heavier clip, note our average clip of
1925, from four to five pounds, as against an average clip from
the same herds a few years ago of two and one half pounds.

One of the three Farmer positions was abolished during
the year, leaving but two farmers and one stockman. Much of the

purchase price being paid upon delivery, one third the following
spring and the remainder the following fall. All payments have
been met promptly. From recent reports it would appear that 75%
of the sheep of this jurisdiction are somewhat improved from the
old Navajo strain. Wool, produced in this country, is graded by
buyers as "improved", "partially improved", and "Navajo". The
past spring improved wool brought the Navajos 55¢, partially
improved brought 50¢, and Navajo brought 25¢. The average clip
on the reservation was between four and five pounds. The flock of
Bob Bekiss averaged over eight pounds, the heaviest clip of the
.jurisdiction.

Not all of the sheep of the jurisdiction were dipped
in 1924. The Bureau of Animal Industry were unable to secure
sufficient trained men to meet their demands and, as the San Juan
jurisdiction was practically free from scabbies, they decided to
dip only those sheep that range along the eastern boundary of
the reservation, consequently-large portions of the jurisdiction
received no general dipping. When the order came out, I was pleased
as I felt it would relieve the Indians of,a lot of expense and this
office of a lot of work. However, I trust we have no repetition.
All the fall and winter, I listened to one complaint after another.
Wherever the sheep were not dipped there was complaint. It was but

a few years ago that these Indians, or many of them, seriously

objected to dipping. But I am fully prepared to state that this '

Annual Report, 1925. San Juan Agency.

ence of a District Farmer and eVen such influence as we have

been able to establish is now necessarily reduced. One of the

remaining Farmers is stationed at Aneth, Utah, 55 miles north

west of Agency Headquarters; and one at Tocito, 29 miles south

of these Headquarters. Both are furnished with Ford touring cars,

and the one at Aneth is also furnished with a saddle horse.

There are fourteen licensed Traders on the jurisdiction

and one Navajo Trader. Just off the reservation to the east and

to the north are many Traders, who, not being located upon restricted 32

land, operate without licenSe. The licensed Traders are in my opmn-

ion fair and upright in their business deaaings.
The Saw mill, located on the mountain above Toadlena,

burned during the year. The engine and planer were re-babbitted

and continue to serve, but the mill itself together with the

Shed covering'ﬂﬁﬁc destroyed and had to be replaced. We are in

a fair way now, barring further misfortune, soon to be able to

sunply the demand for lumber. A considerable quantity was sold

to Indians this year, but the supply failed to meet the demand.

There are many Indians Of the jurisdiction that need

work and that would gladly accept it could it be secured near

home where they would not be required to absent themselves from

their families and their flocks. During the year they have done

a great deal of freighting to the different oil fields, in fact

have handled all the freight for these Companies. Practically

every one owning a freight outfit has been busy throughout the

Section V --~—~——Allotments.

No lands have ever been allotted in severalty on this
jurisdiction, nor should there be at this time. Held as a Tribal
possession the reservation supports the tribe. Divided into
allotments it would be of little value. The range is considered
common property. When a family creates a wetter—supply where
none existed before, it is considered private property.'When a
family causes grain or crops to grow where none grew before, the

tract upon which they are grown is in like manner considered pri-

vate property. Rights of this character, upon the death of the

head of the family, descend to the children and other heirs.

Annual Report, 1926. ' San Juan Agency.

employees now, as a rule, are suitably and comfortably housed.
The Camp School Unit of the San Juan School, sometimes called
the Mesa School, the construction of which doubled the capacity
of the San Juan School, was completed and turned over by the
buildBBS'in late June 1925. To prepare this plant for occupancy
required a great deal of work and, as the establishment of this
unit had not increased the mechanical force of the San Juan
School, this work fell upon a crew whose numbers had already
been reduced to a minimum, considering the work of the old

plant alone, a crew that already had a full burden. This
additional work necessarily meant that much repair work at

the old plant must be temporarily neglected while the new

task was being accomplished. All available employees were put

at this task and most of the summer and fall were thus consumed.
A person who has no actual experience in opening a school plant
turned over as this plant was can have little conception of

the volume of work involved. There were floors to clean, windows
to wash, screens to make and put in place, shades to assemble
and place, stoves to set up, chairs to assemble likewise stools,
wardrobes to make, shelving to make and place, school desks

to assemble and place, flour bins to make, coal bins to make,
and literally scores of other things that must be fabricated
and placed or installed before the children and employees

could occupy. The old plant is in such condition that any
little neglect thereof, even for a short time, is Very ap-
parent. However, the new work has nearly all been assimilated
and much of the repair work on the old plant is now in process
of completion and it is believed the mechanical force, as it
exists, will succeed in mastering the situation. However,

they are by no means "out of the woods" at the present writing.

The clerical force is short handed and has been for_the
past three years. Auditor Walker noted this and in his latest
report cOVering cenditions at this place, while complimenting
this force upon the volume and quality of the work turned out,
said he knew of no other place in the Service where additional
clerical help is so badly needed. The recent resignation of
Jaspercw. Elliott, chief clerk, makes this condition doubly
acute. For_Mr. Elliott was a man of many years'ekperience,
rapid,.and accurate, not averse tohworking Sundays and over-
time. During his stay at Shiprock he did practically the ,
work of two clerks, and unless a successor of equal experience
and ability, and of like disposition can be found additional
clerical help will be a necessity. '

There is also a lack of field employees. For the entire
jurisdiction there are provided but three field men,- two

Annual Report, 1926. San Juan A gency.

District Farmers and-one Stockman. The one stockman covers
the ground thoroughly. But with only two d.istrict farmers it
is patent that large sections of the jurisdiction receive
but very superficial supervision. Lilcewise, the jurisdiction
is provided with but two physicians, one statmoned at Ship-
rock and one at Toadlena forty miles south of Shiprock, and
it follows that large portions of the reservation are almost
entirely lacking in medical attention.

No great difficulty is met in maintaining law and order
within the jurisdiction. The Navajo is naturally peaceable
and peace-loving. As a rule he is so busy trying to gain a
livelihood that he has not much time for mischief. Of course,
there are exceptions.to this rule, occasionally a Navajo
develops into a bad man, and when he does he is decidedly
bag. However, the most of our trouble consists of occasional
quarrels over range and water rights and these together with
an occasional "family row" constitute by far the larg er part
of the minor offenses. These are for the most part trivial
in their nature but, if.not given prompt consideration by
the Superintendent or some of his assistants, they soon assume
larger proportions, sometimes with serious consequences. In
addition to the class of offenses mentioned abovem there has
been one murder, the perpetrator immediately suiciding, and
one case of rape during the year. -

The Havajos are too busy to waste much time in prolonged
dances. The two chdef dances are known as the Yabaitsi and the °
Fire Dance, and according to their customs these may be held .
only during the winter months "when the lie ghtning end the bears
and the snakes are asleep" and even so they are usually limited
to not more than one each season. These are not social dances
but are conducted by medicine men in the treatment of the sick
and, as it costs in the neighborhood of $500 to finance either
of these dances, it necessarily follows that few of the siCk
are able to avail themselves of this treatment. In addition
to these two dances the medicine men, in treating disease,
conduct what are locally known as "sings". These are not
dances as that term is usually interpreted but are a ceremony
used in treating the sick and, until such time as a more
intelligent treatment is available, it would scarcely be proper
to deprive or to attempt to deprive, them of such medical

assistance as they may secure through this source.

There have been during the year several marriages con—
summated in compliance with state law. However, the total
number of such marriages, when compared with the total number

Section III -~-- Schools.

It is not easy to describe the relationship that
exists between the public school and the Indian schools
or the San Juan hurisdiction for they scarcely touch at
any point. There is a public school at Toadlena about
200 yards from the Toadlena Boarding School, which is
maintained solely ior the accommodation of the children
of the Indian Trader, the local Missionary, and the
Government Employees. In addition to these white children
there were nine Indian pupils attending this public school
the past year. These are the children of Indians that
reside in the ficmnity of Toadlena. The very friendliest
relations exist between these two schools, there being
no evidence of any unpleasant racial feeling. Indian
pupils are welcomed-at this school and are made to feel
at home there. A public school is likewise, and for like
reasons, maintained at Shiprock. However, there are no
Indian children in attendance except two boys who last
year completed the sixth grade at the San Juan School
and who desired and intended to enroll at the Sherman
Institute last fall. These boys sought and secured em—
ployment for the summer months in Colorado and were out
of touch with the Superintendent. When they returned about
September first, it was to learn that the Sherman Insti-
tute was full and, as they were unwilling to accept trans-
fer to other Indian schools to WhiCh transfer was possible,
they re-entered the San Juan School and were permitted
to take the seventh grade in the local public school. These
boys took.this work side by side with white children and
their teacher advises that the quality of work done by
them was fully equak to that done by the whites. There is
no thought of racial feeling. The Methodist Industrial-
Mission near Farmington permitted one of their pupils to
attend public school in Farmington. Other than in these
three instances, there is, so far as I know, no place
where the public school touches or affects the Indians
of the San Juan reserVation.

.The San Juan School proper has an enrollment of a
little over 800, or considering it in connection with
the Mesa Unit, of a little over 400, with a like at-
tendance. Its most serious drawback is and always has
been its domestic water supply. This supply comes from
three different sources:-

of reservation marriages, is very small. It may not be
generally known nevertheless it is true that the Navajos
have a very clearly defined marriage ceremony of their own
and a very large percentage of the marriages of the juris-
diction are performed in conformity therewith. The prelim-
inary arrangements are all made by the parents and kinsmen
of the contracting parties and, when completed to the sat—
is faction of all, a feast is given during which the actual
ceremony is performed.‘ There are Very few people on the
jurisdiction living together as husband and wife who have
not had their union solemnized by the state law or by tribal
custom. The Navajos do not look with favor on a union that
has received no solemndzation.

All misdemeanors and offenses, except those of a serious
nature, are handled by the Indian Court, consisting of two
judges, the police force, and the Superintendent. This Court
sits on the last day of each month and remains in session
until all matters brought before it have been disposed of.
This usually requires the better part: of two days and
occasionally there is a little "hang over" into the third
day. Everything is done methodically and in order and the
conclusions reached and the sentences meted are usually
satisfactory to all parties concerned, even to those most
vitally intesested.

There are five religious organizations operating on
this jurisdiction. Heretofore, there have been but four,
but during the past year the Roman Catholics have kept a
man, with headquarters at Waterflow, H. M., working among
the Indians. As this man almost never visits Shiprock this
office knows nothing of the nature or scope of his activities.
Aside from this there has been but little change in the
situation during the year. The Rev. L. P. Brink, formerly
stationed at Toadlena, is now located at Farmington. ie is
still actively engaged in mission work on the reservation,
the only difference being that,whereas formerly his activities
were limited largely to the Toadlena District, he now covers
the entire jurisdiction. Mr. Brink was succeeded at Toadlena
by the Rev. J. C. Kobes. The Presbyterian Mission has strength-
,ened its force at Shiprock by the addition of two assistants.
Other than these the year has brought no changes so far as
I have learned. -

as funds become available. Such equipment is being purchased
at the present writing for the-Mesa Unit. A concrete
sidewalk is also needed conneotmng the two units.

This past year the school farm produced more abundant-
ly than it did during several preceding years. It is too
early in the season to predict the outcome of this year‘s
activities. A very special effort has been mede'to produce
not alone ensilage and hay for the dairy cattle, but con-
centrates as well, and not alone for the cattle but for
the hogs as well. We are also endeavoring to produce pota-
toes for the San Juan and Mesa Schools, altho the outlook
is not so promising as one might wish. Last year an attempt
was made to produce potatoes for all the school of the
jurisdiction on the mountain top above Toadlena._Twenty
acres were planted, however, instead of the 5,000 bu. that
we hoped to produce, we harvested only 500 bushels, simply
enough for the Toadlena School. This year the Toadlena School

will again raise its potatoes on the mountain top and the
San Juan School hopes to raise its own on the School farm.
In the school garden, tomatoes, cabbage, sweet corn, carrots,
rutabagas are being stressed, tomatoes for canning, sweet
corn for drying, the others for storing for winter use.

We hope to can at least 4,000 half gal. bottles of tomatoes,
and to dry about'4,000 pounds of dried sweet corn. Lest-
yeardﬁpdrying efforts were not as successful as one might
wish owing to the rainy weather through-out the drying sea-
son. This year we have constructed an eVaporator, built _
upon‘specifioations furnished by the Department of Agricul-
ture, and expect to be independent of the weather.

The employees have, for the most part, shown an earnest,
conscientious endeavor to accomplish. Visiting officials
report both the academic and the health work to be good,
and the Superintendent is somewhat of the same opinion. The
school farmer at Shiprock is handicapped by a lack of ex-
perienCe and by the further fact that.he lacks system and
organization in his work. He should not be permitted to
remain in the position. The physician at Shiprock has been
greatly handicapped by his lack of skill in surgery. The
position is anVacant and care should be exercised in fill-
ing ' . man skillful both as a
physician and as - has been too much sick—
ness among the teaching force,'but, on the whole, employees
have been loyal to the Service, the Schools and to themselves.

There has been no iriction of slipping of belts due to
petty quarrelings or bickerings.

It has been more or less epidemic on the reservation for
the past two years. During the winter 1924-25 it ran
through the Ioadlena school and during the past winter
through the schools at Shiprock. I believe it has reached
the remotest corners of the jurizsdiction. So Iar as school
children are concerned there were no apparent ill-Issults.
II there were fatalities among the reservation Indians, they
were 1ew for no reports 01 unuc ual death from this cause

cached the office during the year. This is probably due
in la 3-e measure to the balmy weather experienced through-
out the late fall and early winter when the disease was
rampant. ﬁt least conditions were very different from those
existin3 du1in3 the severe winter of 1928—24 when measles
broke out along the Chaco with such fatal results that we
found it necessary to open a Iield hospital at Iocito. In
the San Juan school measles appeared in mid-sumner and
continued as long as new pupils were coming in, which was
about December first.

Iumps, which ran its course in the San Juan School
during the year 1924-25, made its appearance'in the Toad-
lena School this year and all pupils had it. It also showed

its elI in many parts oI the reservation. -

During the past two years Diphtheria has appeared on
two or three occasions in diIIerent arts oI the reservation
and has been promptly suppressed by the adminis‘ration oI
the proper serum. It threatened the San Juan school in early
March of this year but was confined to eight cases, none of
which was very ill.

Chicken pox came about the same time as the Diphtheria
and a large number of pupils were ill, none seriously.

Influenza ran its'course throu3h-out the entire juris-
diction, beginning in February. Practically every pupil in
our schools was sick and fully 60% of the employees. It was
not particulaily serious except that so many peo1le were down
with it at the same time that there were scarcely enough well
people available to wait upon the sick. So Iar as pupils and

seek transfer to some of the non-reseertion schools. Hence,
we have little opportunity to judge the character of our

own graduates. When these same pupils return to the reser-
Vetion, having completed their course at s non-reservation
school, they have taken on the molding and character of

the non—reservation school and little resemble the unso-
phisticated little boys and girls that left the home

school. Returning as graduates from the non-reservation
schools, the girls seek and secure employment as domestics
in the smell towns lying just north and east of the reser—
vation, where they remain for a few years, ultimately
returning to the reservation where they marry and once
more take up the burden of reservation existence where it
was broken off some 14 or 16 years before. The boys seek
and secure employment in nearby Colerado or New Mexican
parts, in the mines, the lumber camps, the smelters, on
the rail road, with the ranchers, etc., etc., where they
receive from three to five dollars per day and where many
of them seem to make good. A few return to and are assimi-
lated by the reservation, better fitted to occupy and
maintain a place in the world, even if it be a reServstion,
world, by reason of their ability to read, write, speak

end understand English, and to meet white people on s

common footing.

lfter three year‘s residence among the Navajo I
have not materially changed the impressions gained during
the first year. Rather these impressions heVe been strength-
ened. In the Report of June 30th 1924 it was stated;

The Navajo is ”different”. He combs his hair
differently; we ks differently; liVes differ-
ently; thinks differently; eats differently;
dresses differently; works differently; saves
differently.

The Navajo is self-supporting and always
has been and it keeps him mighty busy. To ex-
rtract a living from the Navajo desert is a mighty
serious mutter and requires constant planning -
and the continuous effort of every member of
the family.

There is little idhhaeSs, hence little immorality,

little vice. They work; they save, they endeavor to accu—
mulate, and, if they fail in their endeavor, it is not so
much lack of effort as it because of lack of opportunity.

Annual Report, L926. San Juan Agency.

In my judgement it would be practical
to establish temporary tent hospitals for
the treatment of reservation patients. Miss
Eleanor D. Gregg, Supervisor of Field Nurses
and Field Matrons, visited Toadlena during
the late winter making a study of the possibil—
ities along that line. With Principal Hashbarger
and myself she visited many hogans, acquainting
herself with conditions.

t is impossible to know to what extent
venereal disease exists. It is but rarely that
a case is seen for treatment, hence, one might
conclude that these diseases are not very com-
mon among the Navajo. During the year I have
seen but one such case. During the year a total
of 1210 patients have sought and obtained treat-
ment. I will not endeavor to list these diseases
so treated, but according to my records these
have been cdassed under 76 heads, and as has
been stated only one case of venereal disease
has been seen.

With the completion of the school hospi-
tal, annurse and an assistant, possibly two
assistants, will be necessary to_carry on the
work of the school. For reservation work there
should be an additional physician , who should
visit at regular intervals different portions
of the jurisdiction, holding clinics. There should
also be field nurses and field matrons,especially
the former. Miss Gregg went fully into these mat—
ters at the time of her visit. Nothing has ever
been done to reach the women on this jurisdiction
and at first it will be very difficult owing
to their religious beliefs which call for 'cer-
tain rites and ceremonies on certain occasions
when the white man administers'treatment of an
altogether different character, but possibly
by continued effort these things could be overs
come.

We have made and are making a conscientious
and painstaking effort to carry out the Health
hrogram at the Toadlena School, both in spirit
and in letter, so far as our facilities will per-
mit, we have no hospital or hospital equipment,
or nurse, or field matrons, or outside stations
such as the Program calls for. So far as this
Program has to do with school work it has been

adopted and is being carried out in its every

Annual Report, 1926. , San Juan Agency.

With the range grazed to its capacity, there is not an
abundance of opportunity for the sheep owner to increase
his herds, nor is there an abundance of opportunity for
the returned student, who by reason of his long absence,
. has lost his inherited range, to repossess these rights.
As I have stated above, the only limit to accumulation
is the limit of opportunity and these limits are mighty
well defined on the Navajo reservation.

There Were about 550 new pupils taken fromi;he
San Juan reservation during the year. Two hundred and twenty
of these were placed in the Mesa Unit of the San Juan
School which was opened for occupancy in the late summer;
about one hundred were placed in the J‘oadlena School to
replace.pupils that had been transferred and to fill the
new capacity created by the construction of sleeping
porches; and the remainder filled vacancies created at
the San Juan School by transfers to non-reservation Schools.

It is known that there are remaining on the juris—
diction children of school age that ought to be in school.
How large or small this number may be we have little accurate
means of ascertaining. In March a letter was written to all
licensed Traders, Missionaries, etc., operating on the
reservation, asking for specific information. These people
were requested to furnish the names of Indians, trading
with or known to them, having children of school age, to—
gether with the sex and approximate ages of such children.
when a Government employee goes out after children the
parents are immediately suspicious and conceal the children
or send them for the time being to live with friends or
kinfolk residing in other parts of the country, but the
Trader and Missionary, being intimately associated with
the Indians all the time,'can learn of the existence of
the child without causing suspicion. These people have been
mighty niCe about‘the matter and responses have been had
from most of them, the returns showing about 150 children
of school age now out of school on the jurisdiction. This

some duplications. The two district farmers, the stockman,
and the superintendent have also been endeavoring to locate
every child of school age remaining out of school and we
feel that the opinion now expressed represents approximately
the number of children remaining on the reservation. It least
it is not wholly conjecture. We are under instructions to
transfer this season

for two hundred pupils. All pupils are in

the Primary Division and with four teachers

but one grade, the younger beginners, are

enabled to attend classes ell dei.

Due to the trssnfer system or policy

this school has had no graduates. The

third grade is the highest this year altho

it is hoped that en sdditionel grade may

be added each year until six grades are

carried in 1929. Transferring these little

children from the lower grades does not

appeal to the parents. 1

It is thought tint a steady advance has

been made by the Indians of this district in

regard to hes th, sanitation, and industry.

There has been excellent cooperation between

the agencies for the education, civilization,

and Christienizetion of the he sjo of this

district during the pest year.

and this process was repeated until the school

authorities at Theodore Roosevelt requested

that they be not returned any more. Then they
V were picked up and returned to the San Juan

developed the habit and caused us considerable
‘ grief, not only deserting themselves but taking

has been stamped out so far as the local school
is concerned.

Returned students have a rather diffi—

Section IV --—- Industries.

We have a very definite program of industrial ad-
vencement end this program has not varied much since we
received our first impressions of the Navajo deseet. The
Annual Report for 1924 for this jurisdiction reads in pert
as follows:-

He have s very definite program of in-
dustrial advancement.

(a) We prepose to operate a sew~mill and
operate it in such a manner that lumber may
be procured'by all needing it nith no expense
to the consumer other then expense of labor.

This will enable the Navajo, if they wish,
to get away from the much condemned type of
dwelling which they now occupy,- the Hogan.
It will enable them to substitute wooden
structures for sand and brush structures in
their little privately owned irrigation
ditches.

(b) We propose to make it possible for
them to conserve in reservoirs some of the
flood waters so that they may have water for
irrigation purposes even after the spring
flood waters heVe subsided.

As it is to-dey, and as it always has
been, 90% of the privately owned ditches to-‘
tally leek water as soon as the snows have
disappeared from the'hills. As yet we have
no means of knowing how many reservoirs of
this character may be bui t but we are cer-
tain that several at least are capable of con-
struction. When this work is once undertaken
it may develop that possible reservoir sites
are numerous.

(c) We prOpOSe to develop every spring
and every seep on the jurisdictiOn to its
capacity end, when this is done, we propose
to construct reservoirs (surface tanks) to
impound flood water and melting snow and rain
for stock purposes. When this is done we pro—
pose to drill wells in e 1 such areas as are
still lacking stock—water.

Our ideas have changed but little since we first viewed

ventilated, at its best an ideal desert home, at its worst
far better than the hermetically sealed log houses that
have brought disease and death to so many Indians.

' Whe saw mill continues to operate on the plan fhllowed
last year. During the summer and fall two men are kept
busy preparing logs for the mill yard. Later in the

fall, when the farm work for the season has been completed,
two farm teams, one from the San Juan school and one from
the Toadlena school, are sent to the forest to place these
logs in the yard. The lumber is fabricated in February
and March. This plan was varied somewhat this past season
as it became necessary to cut out some 50,000 feet in the
late fall and early winter for special purposes, otherwise
the plan as outlined was followed.

The demand for lumber from Indians shows no decrease.
They are charged twenty dollars per thousand at the mill
and pay under the reimbursable plan. They have never before
had access to lumber and it would appear that the demand
would continue for~some years. It is used by the Indians
for roofs, floors, doors, irrigation structures, etc. The
supply available for sale to Indians was somewhat reduced
this year by other unexpected demands. The citizens of
Cortez, Colo.and the adjacent country decided to grade
a'road from Cortez to Shiprockuto connect with the Federal
Aid highway that is building from Gallup to Shiprock, and,
as 20 miles of this road was on the San Juan jurisdiction
and the work all being done by donation, the San Juan office
furnished 50,000 feet of lumber for bridges and culverts.
Then it was proposed to remodel two cottages at the Toadlena
school and this required an additional 20,000 feet. It is
further proposed to erect a frame building at Shiprock to
accommodatdﬁmn class rooms and for gymnasium purposes and
this required an additional 60,000 feet. All of which cut
into the available supply.

I might state that there can be no economic development
of grazing until something is done to get rid of these
worthless ponies that infest the range. It is estimated
that there are from 15,000 to 50,000 ponies and horses on
the San Juan jurisdiction. Of course a few of these are
valuable, but many of them are almost if not quite worthless.
Were it not for the fact that the Navajo eats horse meat,
and slaughters his ponies for food purposes exactly as he
would slaughter a sheep or a goat, I would say that the

EDUCATION DIVISION - REGARDING INDUSTRIES.

The climatic conditions at Santa Fe are. affected
by altitude, same being approximately 7000 ft. Thevsumner
season is short, but the winters not severe, it rarely reach-
ing 7 degrees'below zero. The spring is always cold and back—'
yard, early- planting not being profitable. Among the different
puebloe climatic conditions varies. At Tao's and Picuris con-
ditions are much the sane as at Santa Fe. At San Juan, Nembe,

San Ildefonso and Tesuque, the climate is warmer in smer, and

. the growing season, slightly longer. This is more marked at

Cochiti, Santo Domingo. Janez and 81a.

‘ All puebloe as a rule cultivate small plots of
groand, averaging from two to four acres per family. There are
exceptions .toithis estimate. There is no particulat increase
or decrease in acreage cultiw'rated, all depending on the pop-

REGARDING INDIAN TRAINS.

There are no licensed Indian traders among the Pueblos.

There are no Pueblos engaged in any of the occupations
herein mentioned, unless it be two Indians Who have very small
stores: one at Jemez and one at Cochiti.

The two Indians mentioned have only small capital, not to
exceed $500 each.

Nb clerks.

Cannot give amount of business done by the two Indians'
mentioned; same is very small, possibly each does one

thousand dollars worth of business annually.

majority of these ponies are wholly worthless, and even
worse than that,— an unmitigated nuisance. The Navajo,
intelligent as he may be and is in some respects, still
adheres to the old J'ndian idea that wealth is represented
by numbers of ponies. The more intelligent realize that

the pony is a nuisance and a handicap to range development,
and for the past three years we have discussed the matter

in season and out of season. In other words we ”go round
and round” but never get anywhere. They will never volun-
tarily slaughter their ponies simply to make room for
increased bands of sheep.‘Hor can the Government arbitrarily
slaughter them. Nevertheless, something must be done.

These ponies appropriate range and water to the detriment
of the sheep. It is possible that a market could be created,
a soap factory might be interested, or a packing house

( they are fat and in splendid shape during the late fall
and early winter months), a fertilizer factory might take
them. If all other things fail, the ”overnment might, with
the consent of the Navajo, kill or castrate all male

animals and_kill all ﬁemalessnimals under a specified weight,
paying the haVajos a stipulated price, and then purchase
range-bred stallions weighing.from 1100 to 1200 pounds,

and place them on the range, using oil royalties for all
payments. These ideas may seem fanciful, but, as I have

said above, something must he done. Deieloping the water
simply means more water to subsiSt more ponies to tramp

out more grass.

We propose to continue to.breed—up the sheep OWned
by the Navajos by the introduction of pure bred sires.
As the condition exists to—day probably 75% of the sheep in
of the jurisdiction are half-breed or better Rambouillet.
The wether lambs sold last fall averaged better than 58
pounds, one flock averaged 68 pounds. t is the opinion
of the Traders that the fleeces this spring averaged better
than 4 pounds, one herd averaged better than 8 pounds.

If cattle ever "come back", and it now looks as
though this might be a possibility, we propose to intro-
duce pure bred Hereford bulls. No one knows how many cat-‘
tle the San Juan Navajo possess, but it is certain they
have several thousand thatv have been in-bred from the
beginning. I have talked a great deal to the Indians about
the introduction of new blood and many of them are ready.
Hewever, we do not deem it advisable to purchase these
bulls with funds derived from the sheep. The sheep support
themselves, the Havajos, the ponies, and we do not deem it
advisable to place the additional burden of the cattle upon

employees are concerned no serious results followed. However,
Influenza claimed several victims on the reservation. Just
how many We have no means of determining for the vital statis-
tics reaching this office are very meager.

Sanitary conditions on the reservation and in the Indian
homes are never extremely bad, for these Indians, being sheep-
herders and nomadic by nature, do not as a rule remain in one
locality long enough for it to become very filthy. '

There has been no regular sanitary inspection of Indian
homes owing to the limited number of available employees and
to the vast areas involved. In fact there are large sections
of the jurisdiction that are not visited by Government
employees regularly.

Another physician, one that was not tied to a school
and that could hold clinics at regular stated intervals in
different parts of the ﬂurisdiction, would be very desirable
and greatly appreciated by everyone except the Medicine man
who now holds practically undisputed sway and who is inclined
to be jealous of his prerogative.

Under present conditions, little is done to combat tuber-
culisis. Occasionally a case is sent to the East Farm Sanito-
rium, or to Laguna and occasionally an incipient case is
placed in the San 5ruan Hospital or a more adbanced case is
placed in a tent-house located in close proximity to the
Hospital where hospital attendants can wait upon it. However,
there has been no systematic campaign.

An active and persistent campaign against trachoma has
been waged through-out the year in the schools of the juris-
diction, apparently with considerable suCCess. Especially is
this tsue in the Toadlena School where Dr. James D. Kennedy
has reduced the number of cases from about 50 to a half
.dozen. Considerable work of this nature was attempted on
the reservation by Dr. Wigglesworth, who did some very ef-
ficient work early in the year.-Unfortunately Dr. Wigglesworth
was not permitted to follow it up, hence, the permanent behe—
fits resulting are not what they would have been had the
work been better fmdlowed up.

The San Juan Hospital has been utilized to its capacity
through-out the greater portion of the year, chiefly with
epidemic patients. There have been not many cases from the
reservation receiving treatment. Personally, I have not noted

Section I ~-—- Law and Order.

The San Juan reservation, one of the five Navajo juris-
dictions, lies in three different states,— New Mexico, Ariz-
ona, Utah. From east to west, as the crow flies, the jurisdic-
tion extends approximately loo miles, however, as a man travels
by auto in making this journey, the road proves to be something
like 150 miles. There is but one east to west road and condi-
tions must of necessity be good, if he be fortunate enough
-to make the one—way trip between sunrise and sunset when the
days are at their longest. Its widest extent from north to
south is approximately 80 miles and the traveler will find
this 80 miles one of the longest he ever undertook to nego-
tiate,‘and, to traverse it, requires more time than does the
east to west trip.

In this territory reside something like 6000 or 7000
Navajo Indians. The exact number is not known as no census
has ever been kept. In fact the taking of a census presents
very unusual difficulties and could be accomplished only by
the expenditure of a very considerable sum of money, and,
as there is no means of securing vital statistics, its
accuracy could not be continuing, hence its value would be
slight.

Reservation headquarters are at Shiprock, N. M., where
are located the San Juan School with its Camp unit, the San
Juan Hospital, and the San Juan Agency. Here also are two
trading posts, a hotel, a 30st Office, and a garage. Shiprock.
is 100 miles north of Gallup, N. M., from which tOWn a
Federal Aid Highway is in process of construction, and 52 miles
West of Farmington, N. M. from which town a hard-surfaced
State Highway is contemplated. Gallup is on the main line
of the A. T. d S. F. Ry.., and Farmington is a terminus
of a branch of the D. & R. G. W. Ry. Shiprock has telephonic
communications with Farmington, where connection is made with
the Bell line and with the Western Union. Daily (except
Sunday) mail service is had with both these towns.

Some changes have been made at Shiprock during the past
year. A building known as the Old Hospital has been remodeled,
a second story added, and is now used as employees quarters,
dining room and kitchen. It makes an attractive building, both
inside and out, and serves its purpose admirably. With the '
occupancy of this building, the shortage in quarters, which
has heretofore at times been {ether acute, ceases to exist and

Annual Report, 1926. San Juan Agency.

Prior to 1925 the only water available, from Decem—
ber to March inclusive, was pumped from a surface well.
This well is still in use. Prior to the fall.of 1925 it
developed water in quantities sufficient for the needs
of the school. However, nothing could be said in favor
of its quality except that it was wet. It was not fit
for human consumption; the clothing came from the laundry
to all appearances more dingy and less fit for use than
it was when taken to the laundry; beans and articles of
that nature could not be cooked therein; when used in
the greenhouse, it killed all vegetation with which it
came in contact. It was so full of salt and other mineral
that all faucets, bibs, and other valves developed leaks
within a few days of installation and required almost
daily repair. Water pipe.had a life of only a few years;
pressure water heaters were eaten through fromiihe inside
in even less time; steam boilers failed to resist its
corrosive qualities and were continually needing repair.
It was wet and would extinguish fire if available in
sufficient'quantities, which it seldom was. Beyond this
it possessad.nc commendable qualities.

In 1925 a drilled well was completed that developed
a very limited quantity of water heavily impregnated with
sulfur. In the late fall of the same year a concrete
reservoir was constructed in close proximity to this well
into which the well was Caused to discharge. This reservoir
was connected with the steam pump and from it the accu-
mulated water was pumped to the service reservoir on the
hill above the school. The production of this well proved
so inconsequential that the plan was abandoned after the
winter of 1925-24 and this well was directly connected
with the laundry, since which time the only water used in
the laundry has been that produced by this well, a plan
that_has proven entirely satisfactory so far as the laun-
dry is concerned.

As has been stated above, prior to 1925 the only water
available during the winter months came from this surface
well which we have described. During the remainder of the
year water was secured from the Iiogback irrigation canal
by gravity, this water'paSSing directly from the canal
into the pipes, without settling, without filtration, and
without chemical treatment. At all times it Carried in
suspension a tremendous amount of silt and sand and at no
time was there any assurance that it was biologically fit
for human consumption. What the salt and other mineral, ‘
contained in the water of the surface well mentioned above,

available, the swings and slides are never idle except

when the girls are all required to be otherwise engaged.
Tennis, volley ball, base ball, and foot ball are played
by the boys; volley ball by both girls and boys. There is
not sufficient play ground'equipment at the San Juan School
and none whatefer at the Mesa Unit altho steps are now
being taken to provide for the latter named institution.

The-needs of the Shiprock Schools summed up are as
follows:~ ‘

an imrpoved water supply,

'drainage,

protection from San Juan'River flood-waters,

additional class-rooms and a gym. at the San Juan School,
a gymnasium at the Mesa Unit that could also be used

as an assembly room,

a concrete side—walk connecting the two institutions,
play ground equipment at both schools

Employees, almost without exception, have been efficient
and loyal, nor has there been any evidence of lack of har-
.mony and cooperation among them. Accommodations for em-
ployees are for the most part ample and comfortable.

An attempt is made at all times to adapt the school
to the-needs of the Indians; the Health Program is given
a prominent place in the work; much attention is given to
instruction in the use of scales, for, later in life, if
the pupil resides on the reservation, practically all income
will be deriyedi from the sale of lambs, wool, pelts, blankets,
pinon nuts, etc. all of which are sold by weight; special
attention is given to sheep and lamb culture and blanket
weaving; and at Toadlena to the dairy goat industry.

It would appear that Government schools will be needed
on the Navajo juriSdictions for many years to come, at least
on the San Juan jurisdiction,for there is little point of
contact between the Navajos and the Whites and no inter-
mingling of the races. Of the 650 pupils now in school on
this jurisdiction there is not one that is recognized as
being of mixed blood. There are two that might be mistaken
for mixed bloods, but not one that is so recognized. Practic-
ally the only points of contact are through the Government
schools, the Government employees, the Missionaries, and
the Traders, and through those that leave the reservation
to secure employment.

work of this character.

The long needed hospital seems at last
about to materialize. The cottage that the Hon.
H. J. Hagerman built for himself at Toadlena,
when he was Commissioner to the Navajo Tribe,
was turned over to the school, slightly re—
modeled, wired and connected with the school
electric system. The heating plant that had
been in use in the principal's cottage was re-
moved from that cottage and installed in the
Hagerman cottage, and the principal moved his
family into thESe new quarters about April'
first. Then the work of remodeling_the cottag
formerly occupied by the principal was under-
taken, an addition was built to the rear, porches
Were added, and a suitable heating plant purchased.
The work of remodeling this cottage is not a
yet completed and will not be this year as the
funds were exhausted. I understand it is estima-
ted that it will cost about $1000 to complete
the work. This hospital will be a great advan-
tage in our work so far as school children is
concerned but will be wholly inadequate for the
demands and requirements of the reservation
adjacent to the Toadlena School. my experience
leads me to say that there are a large number
on the reservation that need hospital treatment
who are both willing and anxious for medical
and surgical attention.

. No steps have been taken to handle the
tuberculosis of the reservation, except in so
far as the physician has been able to give
treatment in the Indian home and in taking
patients to the sanitoria at Fort Defiance,
Laguna, and Phoenix.

During the present year Dr. A. M. Wiggles-
worth, special physician, treated many cases
of trachoma on the reservation. {e Was operating
around Toadlena during July, August, and part
of September. He had planned to go from here
to Red Rocks, and from there to Aneth, but un-
fortunately he left the Service in September
and the work was dropped. He had previously
treated the school children, this was in Decem-
ber 1924. This treatment of school children has
been vigorously followed up and the disease is
now under thorough control in the school.

are prepared weekly and in advance, one copy
being filed in the school office. School
room equipment is reasonably good. Some cases
could be made and used to advantage in two

of the rooms. The books on the authorized
list seem reasonably well adapted to our
needs and two or more series of each grade
are used.

All industrial and domestic employees
of this school give lessons on the work of
their departments end'in keeping with the
Course of Study requirements.

The girls receive instruction in Home
Training, Cooking, Sewing, eundering, and
Domestic Science or_cooking for small groups
of about family size. The boys receive train-
ing in engineering, carpentering at times,
gardening, shoemaking or rather shoe repair-
ing, farming and stockrassing, and goat
deirying. Lessons are given four days each
week for a period of thirty minutes each.

The school plant is is fairly good shape,

the various buildings being Trom one to
eighteen years old. The greatest need is to
keep them well painted and the stone buildings
well pointed. The heat, light, and water
plants are all in good condition and very
efficient. Excellent water is available for
domestic use.

Employees vary from "fa‘r" to the most
"efficient". Some employees of this school
have little thought of anything aught but
the good of the school. Attention is invi-
ted to the unusually efficient Physician,
Senior Teacher, and J1eed Matron. Accommoda-
tions for smngle employees or those without
children are better then ever before due to‘
the additional rooms constructed last summer.
Sleeping porches were.elso completed at the
same time increasing the capacity of the
school frOm 150 to 200. The old stable and
contents were lost by fire but a much better
bern, 26 x 50, has been put in its pleas by
moving an old abandoned sawmill barn from
the mountain. The work was all done by em-
ployees and pupils and without any extra
expense and without the services of a carpen-

the conditions. The whole economic welfare of the Navajo
hinges on WATRI. First impressions are that little water
is available and that little development is possible.
Better acquaintance with conditions soon proves early
impressions erroneous. A stranger may traverSe this desert
for weeks and never find a sprilg and he may conclude
there are none. However, let someone start developing

one spring and the Indians immediately call his attention
to others and early impressions are soon modified. There
are many springs (seep holes, water holes, call them what
you may). As yet, no one knows how many. In their natural
state they are freghpntly simply a menace to stock. Stock
is attracted to them by the SMELL of water and bog down
and die in an effort to secure it. Properly developed there
is no mud hole and no wastage of water, every drop of water
that the ”hole" is capable of producing is condusted to

a concrete trough where itfavailable and easily accessible
to stock. The work of developing these "holes" was begun
in 1924, continued in 1925, and is again being prQsecuted
this season. It is a work that can be accomplished only

in non-freezing weather.

Nothing has as yet been done about impounding flood
waters, rains and melting snows either for irrigation or
stock purposes but it appears that the hour is approaching
when something will be undertaken along this line, for
»this office has but recently received a letter from Mr.

H. F. Robinson, supervising engineer, under whose supervi-
sion this class of work is necessarily done, advising that,
with the completion of a water-well now drilling on the
jurisdiction, the policy of his office will be changed,

and, igstead of expending large sums annually in the oper-
ation f a well—drilling outfit,.all funds available for
water development on the San Juan jurisdiction will be
expended in spring and surfaceareservoir development. Mr.

' Robinson has also assured this office that further attention
will be given the matter of placing permanent diversion

dams in some of the arroyos or washes of the jurisdiction.
The Indians difert these waters by means of brush and earthen
dams which are carried away by every little freshet and which
cannot be replaced until the freshet has subsided. This ‘
means a tremendous loss of water just at the time when it

is most needed and when nature has made it available. Two
substantial diversions of this nature have already been
placed and other work of this character we hope will follow.

First impressions relative to the Hogan have changed
materially. The Hogan is by no means entitled to the sweeping
condemnation it has received. It is well lighted and well

The leaks in this large reservoir are rapidly seal-
ing up, and we expect to enter the winter this coming
season, providing the canal continues to operate, with
enough water stored to carry the schools through at
least the greater portion of the winter.

Bhen this reservoir is Sealed so that it will hold
water, which i am confidant will happen within the next
year or two, each passing day bringing the desired re-
sult nearer, it will be necessary to construct a fil-‘
tration plant at the point of intake and at the same
time, or before, some method of treating the water
for injurious biological content must be devised, pro-
bably at the outlet of the reservoir where the water.
enters the pipes. Then, and not until then, will the
5hiprock schools have a respectable water supply. Of
course, there is the possibility of securing water
by well-drilling. No. 17 well on the Rattlesnake oil
lease struck a large flow of water in the Navajo sands
This sand was encountered at a depth of 1400 feet and
was about 700 feet in thickness. I am advised that this
flow of water is of excellent quality and quantity and
the Field Superintendent operating this oil field states
thst there is every reason to believe that the same
water could be had in a well drilled on the mesa above
Shiprock and at a total cost of the well of approxi-
mately $27,000.00. The Rattlesanke lease is eight miles
distant from Shiprock. This matter may be worth con-
sideration, especially if anyone doubts the practicabil—
ity of the reservoir. One thing is certain,- until a
suitable water-supply cann be developed, one that is
reasonably free from suspended matter, injurious bacte-
ria, and mineral, the Shiprock schools will labor under
a most serious handicap, toilets will be out of order;
taps will leak; sewers will cause trouble; water-heaters
will be clogged and broken; and typhoid and other bowel
disorders will be an ever present danger.

Another serious need of the San Juan School and
Agency and Hospital is protection from possible floods
an the San Juan River. This menace was mentioned in
our reports for 1924 and 1925 and has been the sub-
ject of considerable correspondence, however, the con-
dition remains unchanged.

A third serious condition at the San Juan School
is the tendency of the school campus, farm, and garden

Annual Report, 1926. San Juan agency.

In the fall of 1925 there were harvested at Shiprock
about 1000 bu. of tomatoes many of which were canned;
sweet corn in quantities sufficient to supply every
fall need and in addition thereto enough for drying for
winter needs; carrots; onions; beets; etc., etc., in
quantities sufficient for all needs and in addition to
this the usual amount of water melons and musk melons,
enough for every possible purpose. We expect that this
year's harvest will equal that of last year and in
addition thereto enough cabbage for all winter needs.

Last fall our drying operations were hindered by rains

occurring during the drying season. We have constructed
an evaporator and have it ready for use and the rains
cannot do us the damage this fall that they did last.
Toadlena School had enough vegetables of all kinds last
year for every possible purpose and will duplicate
last years crops this season.

Two hundred and fifty apple trees were purchased
this past spring and sold to Indians on the reimbursable
plan and the indians purchased quantities-in addition
with personal funds.

Four thousand pounds of alfalfa seed was purchased
and sold to Indians on the reimbursable plan. Twice that
amount would not have exceeded the demand. However,
the demand did not make itself manifest until so late in
the season that the seed could not be purchased to meet it.

Seed corn for the school was purchased in the fall
of 1925 and was personally selected by the bounty Agent.

The Indians of the jurisdiction do comparatively
little farming. It is their aim and desire to raise
enough corn to supply bread for family consumption and
to have a little to feed to their rams during the late
winter and early spring months. In addition to this thcy
they attemps to raise water melons and a few have dittle
fields of alfalfa whioh they are increasing as rapidly as
conditions will permit. They always save corn and water‘
melon seed. They raise some beahs and some wheat and a
few small peach orchards may be found through—out the

jurisdiction.

These Indians are entirely self-supporting and it
follows that they make good use of all stock and supplies
purchased for thank ﬂhey have purchased through the local

Annual‘Report, 1926. San Juan Agency.

at the request of the Superintendent, Mr. W. H.
Hashbarger, who has been principal of the Toadlena School
for the past six years, has prepared a report covering
conditions at that school, which report follows:—

host pleasant relationship has ex-
isted between the local public school and
this institutionnthrough-out the year. This
public schbol'has enrolled nine Navajo
pupils and the white and Indian pupils get
along together pleasantly. The teacher has
been especially tactful in handling a mixed
school. .

The Chief Supervisor, the District
Supervisor, and more recently the Super-
visor of Field Nurses and Field Mhtrons has
called attention to the need of a steam
cooker, a bread mixer,'and a vegetable parer.
The-school farm seems to be developing slow-
ly and there is no pressing need of further
farm equppment except for a small horse pow—
er hay press in order that hay may be baléd
for hauling down the mountain to the school.

One additional employee, a trained nurse
(with possibly an assistant) will be needed
when the hospital is completed. We do not
know when this hospital will be ready for
use. It was planned to convert the cottage
built by H- J. Hagerman when he was Commas-
sionercto the Navajo Tribe into quarters for
the Principal and to convert the cottage here-
tofore used as quarters for the principal
into a hospital. The work on the Hagerman
cottage was completed and the Principal and
his family moved in in late April; the work
on the other cottage was well begun but had
to be discontinued because of lack of funds.
This work should be resumed at the earliest
possible moment. The Toadlena school also
needs a nightwatchman. Things have gone reason-
ably well without a nightwatch for many years
but such an employee would be valuable in
guarding life and property and preventing
unauthorized persons from coming about the‘
school at night. There_are but four teachers

them.‘ When the Hevejos can find a market for some of their
three, four, and five year old steers, it will time enough
to buy new bulls. So far as i know they have not sold a
beef animal, except such as is bought by the local schools
and an occasional quarter by the Traders, since the price
broke just after the World War. During the past few months
we have received a few inquiries concerning young steers,
and have alwais made response tothe effect that young steers
may be purchased here either singly or in car load lots,

but so far the inquiring parties have not put in an appear-

ance on the reservation.

The year wss decidedly more successful on the San
Juan School farm than any of the recent preceding years.
Two open ditches were constructed and as a result a con—
siderable acreage that has not been used for years pro—
duced fair crops and give promise this year. Last fall
the silo Has filled with ensileWe than which there could be
none better. The stalks were heavy, fully lesved, and
averaged at least one fully developed our to the stalk; and
in addition to this there was produced an equal amount
that was hushed end the stalks-used es stover. Enough
er corn was made to carry the hogs through the season.
Two silos of the capacity of the present silo could essily
have been filled, had two such silos been available and
any occasion for filling, and all of this was produced
on land that had for years been water-logged and idle,
a change that was the resu " ne of these ditches.
This year a portion of the Same ' planted to pc-
tatoes about one half of which came up, making about
- half a stand. Those that germinated promise a good crop.
The remainder of this land is again planted to corn and
I believe will yield enough to fill the silo. The second
drain ditch constructed last year is Operating with
equal success. However, it was completed too late in the
season to have much effect on-lest year‘s crop. It? is
my opinion that both of these ditch should be extended.
The experiment to date is satisfactory ,.it is believed
that the seeping of the school ferm,that has been getting
worse and worse for the past 10 or 12 years, has not only
been checked, but that the areas heretofore seeped will
ultimately be all reclaimed, altho, to bring about the
desired condition, the ditches will have to be expended

somewhat.

ting of 100 apple'tﬁsqs, 50 peach trees, and 50 cherry‘

is from 1-1/4 y to 1-1/2 1‘ per pound. The same pr 1.33.9 paid fo
corn. There is no problem of getting the Pueblos to fclJENI agri-
cultural pursuits. They practically know nothing else.

' All of the Pueblos have some stock. mostly horses and cattle,
though a few have small flocks of semen Mexican or native goats,
which are valuable chiefly for the hides and mutton.

The following is a summary of the live stock owned by the
12 pueblos under my Jurisdiction:- I V

Cattle, - - - 2235
Goats, - - - 551
Horses, - - V- 2621

While generally each family may own one or more horses or
ponies, the cattle are generally owned by a few families in each
village. In a few pueblos one Indian mayown possibly fifty head.
The herds are increasing slowly. There is generally free range
on the forest reserves for Indian stock, and the possibilities for
making money in stock raising bylndians is even greater than is
farming. As stated, the Indians are allowed free grazing permits
on all the National Forest Reserves. No particular restrictions
are enforced against Indian stock on these reserves.

Outside of farming and stock-raising, the Pueblos have no
other cceupation.’ They make a few crude baskets, bow and arrows,
considerable pottery, etc., which they peddle in the nearby towns.
They do no blanket weaving, though it has been said that they were

the original blanket weavers. They weave a colored belt from

Germantcwn yarn, Ilhich is a part of the dress of the Pueblo women.

Thisbelt is called a "fa-Ja', and forms an article of trade and

barter. No new industries have been added to the Pueblo life.

officepure bred rams until nearly every hand of sheep

has at least one ram of this character, and many bands have
no other class of sires with them. Hence, T believe it safe
to say -that better than 75% of their breeding stock is

one half or better Rambouillet. Their lambs showed up Well
last fall, averaging better than 58 pounds. I cannot say
that their herds are increasing in number for believe

the range is fully stocked and has been for many years.
However, at the general dipping last fall we dipped a

few thousand more than were dipped at the general dip—
ping in 1925, on each of which occasions it was thought
that all sheep of the jurisdiction were dipped.

These annual dippings are conducted under the imme-
diate supervision of a representative of the Bureau of
Animal Industry. Prior to last fall all animals presented
at the vat were examined by this representative, and, if
no evidence of the existence of scabies was found, the
herd was given a single dipping. If scabies was found
in any animayof a herd, this herd was dipped and then given
a second dipling at a later date. Prior to the fall of
1925, a preparation known as Black Leaf ”40", a tobacco
product, was used. Last fall a coal tar product, known
as Kreso'Ho. l, was used and every animal was given ‘
the first and the subsequent dipping. This change was
made upon advise of the B. A.iI. Scabies was in perfect
control, altho it had appeared through-out the year in
isolated bands, however, lice were rampant and these lice
appeared to thrive on the tobacco product. Through—out
the spring and early summer months the Agency Stockman
and the local representative of the B. h. 1., Dr. H. E.
Pine, were engaged in experimenting with these lice
using different preparations. Samples of all varieties
of lice obtainable were secured and sent to the B. h. I.
authorities at Albuquerque, and, as a result of these ex—
periments, the Kreso No. l was selected for use and a
double dipping ordered. “he result is that lice have
been reduced to a_minimum and no slipping in the control
of scabies has been noted. During the late fall and early
winter months scabies made itself manifest in three dif-
ferent parts of the reservation. These bands were promptly

given a double dipping and the condition seems to be as

nearly perfect as it could be in respect to both lice

and scabies. The B. A. I. advises that no general dipping

will be undertaken this year as they pronounce the juris-

diction "OLEAN" which makes everyone happy. Credit for

this condition is due to Sophus Jensen, Agency Stockman,

failed to do to the school water-system in the winter
months, the send carried in suspension by the water taken
from this canal accomplished during the summer months.
Deposits of silt and sand seVeral inches deep must be
removed almost daily from the flush boxes connected with
the toilets; water-backs, in stoves and ranges, connected
with pressure heaters, plugged up solid, hence their use
was not attempted; water heaters, used to heat bath water
for pupils, plugged full and, as a consequence, were al-
most always out of commision; the suspended send out out
valves almost as rapidly as they could be installed, no
valve seat, no faucet could resist its eroding action.
The result was that for twelve months of the year, regard~
less of expense of time and labor and money,the system
was in a deplorable condition; every toilet was almost
continually out of shape; every valve and faucet contin-
ually leaked; water and sewer pipes were plugged with

mud and send; and water could be heated only in open
vessels.-

In the late spring or early summer of 1925 a large
reservoir was constructed on the mess abOVe the school by
building a dam between the points of two hills, thus
inclosing. a basin or valley which it was estimated would
hold in the neighborhood of 12 million gallons. This
reservoir was under the Hogback canal from which it was
proposed to fill it by gravity and the storage was thought

- would prove sufficient to'carry the schools through the
winter months. Water was first turned into the reservoir
about July first 1925 and the bottom and sides of the
reservoir developed many leaks. The dam itself developed
no leeks but the basin or valley in which it was proposed
to store water developed many leeks. Naturally the silt
and send carried by the water as it enters this reservoir
from the canal will ultimately seal the reservoir and
stop these leeks but this result had not been secured when
a cloud—burst, occurring on September 18th, placed the
canal out of commission at which time the reservoir was
but about one quarter or one third full. This storage sup-
plied the needs of the schools until December‘first, when
it was exhausted, and water for all purposes, except
laundry purposes, must again be pumped from the SURFACE
'WELL. The Hogback canal Was not again placed in operation
until the spring of 1926.

making a total of 150 pupils to be transferred. Later these
instructions were modified and we are advised to transfer
only 50 to the Chas. H. Burke School, all to be boys, thus
reducing the number for transfer this year to 100. To date
the Phoenix quota has been filled and the Theodore Roosevelt

quote is nearly ready.

Work of the_year in the academic department has been
successful; the Uourse of Study has been carefully followed;
daily outlines of instruction have been prepared; end ad—
vancement of pupils has been marked. This advanvement has
been especially noticeable at the Mesa Unit where a unique
condition prevailed, a condition that probably never ex-
isted before and that in all probability will never happen
avein,- 220 children, ranging in age from 5 to 16, were
brought in-from'the camps and placed in this school. With
exceptions numbering fewer than a half dozen these children
were anxious to come and their parents were pleased tmth
the arrangement. ghese pupils all started on an equal foot-
ing, not one of them could speak or understand a word of
English; not one of them knew even a little concerning the
customs of civilization, and almost without exception they
came with a fixed purpose, and from the day of their en-
trance they have kept this purpose always in mind. They
came to acquire a working knowledge of English, to learn
to read and write, and to learn to read scales and to come
puts the value of the articles they have for sale,- wool,
pelts, blankets, lambs, etc., all of which are usually
sold by weight at a pre-erranged valuation per pound. They
have been and are the happiest, most contented, most eager,
most unconscious‘of self, most determined group of children
I have ever seen, and visitors, both official and others,
have inveriaOly made comments of a similar nature. All
being at par, there was none to laugh at mistakes; there
was not One retarding element, and the progress has been
remarkable. As has been stated conditions were unique and
results altOgether desirable.

In our schools the girls are instructed in sening,
both dress-making and mending, laundering, cooking, baking,

Annuel Report, l926. San Juen Agency.

December last, the well failed to develop but about 50%
of its former production, a condition brought about by
a drain ditch which had been dug during the early summer
of 1925. Hence, eltho, due to the opening of the Mess
school, the demands for water were twice as great as
during former years, the available supply was only about
50% of the supply formerly available. At-first we almOS'
despeired securing water in quentitdes sufficient to
war"ent the operation of the school, but, by setting
the pump to operate at the slowest speed possible and
thus operating it continuously from 4:50 A. h. to

10:00 P. M. we managed to keep the pipes full end to
accumulate a little reserve in the reservoir, which
accumulation was usually not sifficient to supply the
requirements of the night, with the result that the
pipes were empty in the morning when the pumpi "was
stsrted..ﬁere the pump operated at a more rapid pace,
the only result was that the supply in the well was
eXheusted in e-very few minutes with a consequent de-
lay of es many hours awaiting e fresh accumulation

in the well. By this method of pumping the water pipes
were empty fully three quarters of the time during the
dey and through—out the night.

The water supply at the San Juen school has always
been of wretched quality but, during the winter 1925-26,
while the quality was unimproved, it was only by the '
most careful and economical, not to say miserly, use
of the available supply that we were able to operate
the school. From the view point of water-supply it was
the worst year the school ever experienced.

I do not wish to be understood as saying that the
large reservoir, constructed in 1925, is a failure,
simply that it failed lest winter to do what it had
been-expected to do, end that this.condition was large—
ly a direct result of the storm of September 18th. Had
it not been for this storm and the resultant damnge to
the Hogback canal, the water stored in this reservoir
would have sufficed for December and January instead
of being consumed in October and Bevember and, in all
probability, had this canal continued to operate as
usual until December first, the quantity stored would
have been considerably greater, possibly enough to carry
the school through the winter.

ter. The goat dairy plan, initiated in this
school by the Superintendent three years ago,
is in line with adapting the school to ex-
isting conditions on the reservation, as cows
cannot be kept on account of the high price
of hay and grain and long distances it must
be hauled and that water is not available to
raise same in quantity. This little herd was
started with three animals, a buck and two
does, and to day we have over 40 animals of
all ages. It has been a means of training the
boys in the care of milch goats which is the
only means they have for dairying at home.

The outstanding feature of the year is
the elimination of trachoma at this school due
to the work of Dr, Wigglesworth, the local phy
sician-Dr. Kennedy, and the hard work of the
head matron- Hrs. Denetdele in the follow up
treatment. There are but six-cases, none ac-
tive, out of an enrollment of 210 pupils this
year. '

Expenditures have been kept as low as
consistent with good management. No additional
money was allotted to care for the 50 additional

children enrolled this year.

Good use has been made of the playground
equipment and of the small school gymnasium
floored with concrete without any expense for
labor. Systematic playground supervision is
given the boys by the disciplinarian, both as
to setting—up eXercises in the mornings
and games between 4:15 and 5:15 each evening.
Girls' evening playground supervision is had
under the direction of the teachers and has
been faithfully'carried out this year. Girls
uSe volley ball, croquet, basket ball, swings,
and teeters, sometimes they play base ball.

' It is probable that this school will be needed
for another generation. Few,n if any, of the
Indians are taxpayers and the County is un-
able to provide public schools for Indians.

An abundance of vegetables was.produced'
at the school,— potatoes,-carrots, rutabagas,
corn, onions, beets, cabbage, turnips, parsnips,
rhubarb, asparagus, radishes,'and lettuce, also
squash and pumpkins.

Pupils of this school received several prises

N. M., 29 miles south of Shiprock. These employees are both
furnished with a Ford car, the man at Aneth also has

'a saddle horse, and each covers as large a portion of the

reservation as he is physically able. They spend their
entire time in the field, advising and assisting in ag-
ricultural and stock rassing operations, advising and as-
sisting in the construction and maintenance of little
privately owned irrigation structures, settling dis-
putes, etc., etc. However, even with their best efforts,
there are considerable portions of the reservation that
see their faces not oftener than'three or four times a
year.

The Stockman, equipped with a car, alsoispends his
entire time in the field, visiting with the ndians,
advising as to the care and maintenance of their flocks,
inspecting suspected bands for scabies or disease, dipping
infected herds, etc., etc, incidentally settling disputes '

as they come to his attention. ur. sophus Jensen has been
acting in this capacity for the past three years, during
which time both scabies and liCe have been brought under
complete control. At the time of his assuming this posi-
tion the reservation was under quarantine which was soon
raised as a result of his intelligent activities. hr.
Jensen is energetic and efficient, well liked by the
Indians as well as by the representatives of the Bureau
of Animal Industry with whom we deal.

The Navajos are sheep raisers, and not in any sense
farmers. Every Navajo owns sheep, whereas, the acreage
available for agricultural purposes is exceedingly lim—
ited. We have no means of knowing how many acres the
San Juan Navajo crop but, in the opinion of the Super-
intendent, it would fall short of 10,000 sures. Even so,
every acre that can be watered is cropped and usually
a considerable acreage is seeded upon which the crop is
more or less of a failure because of shortage of water.
If the snow-fall in the hills is sufficient to cause the
arroyas to run in the spring, this water is diverted into
their fields and permitted to run there so long as there
be any water in the arroya. Then the corn is planted and
if the July rains come they are reasonably sure of a crop.
If the snow-fall in the mountains is not sufficient to
cause the arroyas to run, they do not attempt to plant
any corn. If the July rains fail to materialize the crops
fail and the efforts wasted.

_ No lands have ever been allotted in severalty on
this jurisdiction nor should there be. Held as a tribal
possession, this reservation supports the tribe. Divided
into allotments, 90% of them would be bone dry and of

no value. The range is considered common property.

When a clan or a family builds a tank or develops water
where none existed before it is considered individual

or clan property. When a clan or family takes water from
and arroya and applies it to land and-thereby causes
alfalfa or corn or some other tame vegetation to grow
where no vegetation or nothing but natural vegetation
appeared before, this tract is considered personal or
clan property and the claims of these owners are re-
spected. Natural supplies of'water-and natural vege-
tation are considered common property.

A few, very few, allotments have been made on
Public Domain north of the jurisdiction.

trees. In addition to this 24 black walnuts and about

200 little maples Were set out. The fruit trees and the
walnuts were set out just across the road from the Mesa

Unit of the San Juan School upon land that was reclaimed
from its virgin state last summer when it was cleared of

its natural growth and leveled. This land was selected
because of its location with reference to the school ,
buildings, because of its excellent drainage, and because

it has sufficient area to enable us to increase'the size

of the crcharc from year to year. The maples were set

out on the Mesa Unit's campus, or what will constitute

a campus when it is finished. The maples and walnuts are
doing fine at the present writing but the fruit trees

are not doing so well. I am inclined to attribute this

to the fact that the maples and walnuts were purchased
locally and were set out the same day taken from the ground,
whereas, the fruit trees were purchased in Missouri and
were necessarily in transit for some time. In addition

to this there werepurchased this spring a few pounds

of 6mm and Norway maple seed which were planted with the
hope that in the future we may have trees from our own
nursery ‘with which to beautify the school grounds and
to replace the many Carolina_roplars now on the San Juan
.campus which are rapidly dying. So far this seed has not
germinated.

'This past spring about 50 acres of the mesa farm was
seeded to alfalfa and a fair stand has been secured.

Last year the agan Juan and Toadlena Schools joined
in planting about 20”acres of potatOes on the top of the
mountain above ‘oadlena, hoping thereby to secure potatoes
in quantities sufficient for all school purposes. The yield
was not up to expectations and the entire harvest, 50,000
lbs., was left at the loadlena School. This year, as has
already been stated, we are endeavoring to raise potatoes
for the schools at Shipreck on the San Juan School farm
and at the present writing the prospects are not as encour-
aging as one might wish. "Old Timers" in this locality
advise that potatoes cannot be successfully grown at Ship-
rock, but our partial failure this year by no means dis-
courages us, for we feel that the failure of the seed to
germinate was due to the seed rather than to climatic
conditions or soil, otherwise why would half the seed come
up and one half fail. We expect to try it again next year.
The Toadlena supply will again be produced on the mountain
as it was last year.

H There are on this jurisdiction fourteen licensed
iradres and one, who,being a Navajo, operates without
license. In addition to these there are numerous traders,
living along the northern and eastern borders, who, being
just over the line, operate without license. It is our
opinion that the licensed Trader is, as a rule, fair

in his dealings with the J~ndians. Possibly as much can—
not be said for the traders operating just over the line.

Owing to the activities of the Oil Companies there
‘rs been no lack of-employment for Indians dwelling in
the vicinity of Shiprock. There has been much rreight to
a ’ which has been hauled by Havajos, and in ad-
dition a great deal of day labor,-both single handed and
with team. Indians further out on the reservation have not
been so fortunate and can secure employment only by leaving
home, and large numbers of them do leave home and seek
and secure employment to the north and east, in the lumber
camps, the saw mills, on the rail roads, with ranchers,
stock raisers, and sheep men, with road gangs, and on the
Mesa Verde National Park. They are excellent workmen along
lines that they are familiar with but are slow to take up
new lines. Last year when one of the drain ditches was
being dug on the San Juan School farm, there were approx—
imately lOO Havajos employed at $2.00 per da‘. These men
spent eight hours daily standing in mud and water knee
deep shoveling mud and I was sure standing over them making
them earn their money. Some of the sugar beet growers of
Aztec, N; M., desiring help, called at the Agency and as
a result 15 of these diggers took their time and went to
the beet fields and within a week every one of them was
back seeking his old job. They are slow to take up a
new line of work, but once having acquired the neck they
are excellent at almost any task. A few years ago there ‘
was not a freighter among them that could be classed as
””air", to-day they swarm to Farmington and unload
150,000 pounds of four inch Mndﬁ.pipen3 and have it all

to 14,000 pounds and deliver them at the.oil fields. In

and Dr. H. E. Pine, local representative of the B. A. 1.,
both of which officials have been untiring in their ef-
forts to place scabies under control and to improve the
sheep of the reservation. One new vat was constructed
during the year. This vat was located on the eastern

edge of the reservation near Bistai. It was built under
the direct supervision of the Agency Stockman, the Indians
doing all the hauling and performing all labor. ’Other
vats will be constructed from time to time, as suitable
locations can be determined, and as the Indians can be
prevailed upon to duplicate the efforts of the Bistai
bunch. ,

The winter of 1925—26 was unusually mild and very
littldif any death loss was experienced. All herds win—
tered well and March ended and April begun with ideal
rains that continued for several weeks putting the
range in the best shape it has been in for seVerel years.
However, these-continued rains caused the death of sev-
eral sheep from pneumonia. How large this loss was is
not known but it is believed that several hundred sheep
died from this cause. These rains happened daily and
the sheep had no opportunity to dry out and the result
was pneumonia. This pneumonia was confined to one general
locality and probably there were other contributing
causes,.probably poor feed or lack of natural shelter.

There is no dairying among the uavejos. They milk
their goats and consume the milk after boiling it, but
no attempt is made to milk cows. in fact the Navajo range
is not adapted to mileh cows.

At the San duan School a fine herd of Holsteins is
kept and handled‘advantageously. During the year there
was an average of about 450 pounds of milk per day.
Prior to the opening of the Mesa Unit this supply was
reasonably ample, but with the Mesa Unit addition, the
number of pupils was doubled making the supply insuf-
ficient. During the year seven heifers have developed
into cows. and itiproposed to build the herd up as
rapidly as possible until the milk production again
equals the demand. The Holstein bull calf secured irom
the ’hoenix Indian School in 1924 is developing into a
splendid animal and will be ready for service when re-
quired. The yearling Holstein bull purchased, through
H. J. Eager an, from SpencerrPenrose of Colorado Springs,

0010., has made a fine individual and is now heading

the herd. The Holstein bull secured by exchange with the
Jicarilla Indian School, Dulce, N. H., has been slaugh-
tered for subsistence. Practically the lest of the Short-
horn herd has been disposed of end the Holstein herd

is productive, wruwing and well managed.

The Toggenburg goat herd at the Toedlena School,
which was started in the late fall of 1925 by the purchase
of two grade does and one pure bred buck new numbers over 40
head counting all eges. Last fall a pure bred buck kid
was purchased in Wisconsin snd'is being developed at Ship~
rock. This animal promises well and e soon as he has
reached a suitable age he will be placed with the herd
where it is hoped he will leave his mark. At present this
herd is doing about as well as could be 6X“80t6d. No great
amount of milk is being secured but such as is available
comes in mighty handy for the sick and those needing
special diet.

Blanket weaving continues to be one of the main
sources of revenue. Bracticallj all the women and an
occasional men devote all their share time to this
industry. It has been said that, due to the oil activ-
ity of the jurisdiction, the weaving industry is falling
off. It_is true that there-have been fewer blankets
woven this past year than usual, however, I do not at-
tribute it to the oil activities. It is rather dudto
the immense pinon nut crop of 1925, to harvest which
every man , women, and child was busy. The *rsders of
the jurisdiction estimate that over 400,000 pounds-of-
pinon nuts were gathered and sold during the season, for
which they-parag, ' from 10¢ to 17¢ per pound, or an
average, according to the estimates of the Traders, of
14¢, making a revenue or over $50,000.00 from this
source alone. - - '

The Indians of this jurisdiction have also received
a goodly income from the Oil Companies operating in the
neighborhood of Shiprock. There has been paid them for
labor, freightinr, etc. a total of over $75,000.00..
The income of the San ﬁuan Navajo for the year runs well
over $500,000.00. ’ *

On the jurisdiction there are two District Farmers

and one Stockmsn. One of the Farmers is located at Aneth,

I know of no way that the Office could assis tﬁﬂbﬂanQUL

outside of agriculture and stock-raising, unless it Winemingthg,
furnishing of grafted fruit trees. All of these Indians know some-
thing of fruit culture, but most of their trees are ungrafted and
a poor quality. They take fairly well to fruit growing. The
Pueblos are, and always have been, self-supporting. '

No leases have been made allowing white men to graze stock
on Indian lands. As their uncultivated lands are unfenced, common

herds often graze on lndian lands, but there is no way to stop

same without fencing.l
None of the Pueblos have their lands fenced. It would bev

well if same could be done, but I assume the Office would not care

to go to this expense.
As you know, there are no allotments among the Pueblos. Each

head of a family has a small tract which he calls his own, and same

is generally fenced, though often poorly. This he cultivates and
raises enough for his dire necessities. All of the Pueblos live in

villages, and generally have a house of from two to four rooms.
I have two additional farmers. They give their entire time
.to helping and aiding the Indians in agriculture and other lines.
